        <title>The West Coast Effect</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Coast Effect is the term given to an election controversy that date back to the 1960’s when the national broadcast started. This controversy centers around early reporting on the east coast and the impact it has on west coast voters. While the commonly studied effect on west coast voter didn’t have an effect on 2016 early voting reports might have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first research into in the West Cost effect was done in the 1966 election (Fuchs, 1966; Mendelsohn, 1966; Lang &amp;amp; Lang, 1968), and found to be no evidence of the effect of early reporting, but it had a few problems. One of the issues was that all three studies assume that voter made a decision on election, which is known to only be a few. The voters in the studies only showed that pre-election polls would have caused the west coast voters to stay home, then only hear about a Goldwater upset because that would have changed the results. The other problem was that they ignore the central question of what the effect on the local level. And the biggest one was that the 1966 election was never close so the east coast vote total provided no new information to west coast voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the three Lang &amp;amp; Lang’s book &lt;strong&gt;Voting and Nonvoting: Implications of Broadcasting Returns Before Polls Are Closed&lt;/strong&gt; (1968) was more far-reaching and was considered the definitive study for over a decade. The survey was limited to, Oakland county and the members surveyed (438) resulted large margin of error, and once the early voter were eliminated there slightly more the 100 making the study inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980’s there was a second wave of research on the West Cost Effect, which included multiple studies. Of the studies three of the studies (Delli Carpini, 1984; Dubois, 1983; Epstein &amp;amp; Strom, 1981) used aggregate date rather than surveys to overcome the lack of a sufficient data pool, while (Jackson, 1983) used a much larger survey. While Epstein &amp;amp; Strom (1981), Dubois (1983), and Delli Carpini (1984) used aggregate data, they all chose different details from Epstein and Strom (1981) using regional turnout data (West Coast, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain states, etc.), Dubois (1983) using state level turnout, and Delli Carpini (1984) using congressional districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Epstein &amp;amp; Strom determined that the results were inconclusive. Both Delli Carpini and Dubois found there to be an effect, but Dubois argued this was a unique effect of the 1980 election. Jackson (1983) was different from the other studies because it was able to address the issue of information access, which the other 3 ignored. Because Jackson used a survey from the University of Michigan’s Presidential Election Study and from the Vote Validation Study by the Center for Political Studies he was able to create a pool of 1814 persons who were interviewed both before and after the election. Jackson found that the combination of access to early election returns and hearing Carter’s concession speech reduced turnout between six and twelve percent. There was little evidence, however, that either party was disproportionately affected, but because of statistical errors and among other problems it decrease confidence in the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent study by Peterson (2004) looks to address voter access to information that past studies have ignored. He was able to show a direct effect of early reporting with the average turnout for the informed participants were 31.2%, while it was 71.5% of the uninformed participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/west-bar-graph-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;West Coast Effect Figure showing voter turnout between informed and uninformed participants&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also found that among informed participants that turnout dropped by 19.1% based off of earlier reports, but favored the candidate that lost on the East Coast because those participants turnout dropped only 8.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/west-bar-graph-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;West Coast Effect Figure showing voter turnout between favorable news and unfavorable news&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of Peterson (2004) study shows us that the West Coast effect occurs, and participants who had access to the early election returns were significantly and consistently more likely to stay home than uninformed participants. In the second part Peterson (2004) looked at the effect if one candidate always had the support of a majority of the potential voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/west-bar-graph-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;West Coast Effect With one Candidate having support of a majority&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found when the information supports the majority candidate that informed voters weren’t effective, but uninformed voter turnout decreased slightly from 65% to 59% for majority supporters and decreased from 37% to 25%. When information about the minority candidate show them winning or tiring on the east coast, then minority supports increase from 33% to 55%, while turnout from the supporters of the majority candidate plummeted from 42% to 13%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;effect-on-2016&quot;&gt;Effect on 2016&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the studies are inconclusive the effect on early reporting does have the possibility to affect the outcome of the race and given a headline during and right after early voting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-early-voting-20161027-story.html&quot;&gt;Millions of people have voted, and Democrats are showing strong signs in key states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/voters-guide/article107655357.html&quot;&gt;Could Hillary Clinton win the election weeks before November 8?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on top of the early reporting the voter that did come out to vote were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/how-hillary-clinton-lost-florida-hint-it-happened-on-election-day/2305224&quot;&gt;Super Voters&lt;/a&gt; so when election day came around and everyone from Fox News to MSNBC said that Clinton was in a strong position to win the low prospect voters decided not to show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the election a lot has been said about how Donald Trump won, but when looking at what happened in Michigan and Wisconsin with voter turnout dropping 0.2% and 3.4%, respectively the effects of early reporting should be taken seriously even if the results are inconclusive. Moving forward surveys looking to study the West Coast Effect should move beyond early reporting on election day and examine the effects of early reporting from early voting and the effect it has on election day turnout.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starting a Digital Activist Group</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best places to start an activist group is online because it allows for you to start organizing with low fixed costs. In this article we will talk about the basic to start an online political or issues based campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;starting-the-campaign&quot;&gt;Starting the Campaign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start any political or issue campaign you have to choose a scoop, and while most people what to start and organize nationwide the problem comes down to scale because while a national organization saying they have 750,000 members might seem impressive, but they have no real influence because their support will be spread across 50 states, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_television_stations_in_North_America_by_media_market&quot;&gt;210 designated market areas&lt;/a&gt;, 435 congressional districts, which have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;amp;q=average+number+of+voter+per+congressional+districts&amp;amp;oq=average+number+of+voter+per+congressional+districts&amp;amp;gs_l=serp.3...24138.29411.0.29511.28.28.0.0.0.0.105.2044.23j3.26.0....0...1.1.64.serp..3.9.662...0i7i30k1j0i8i7i30k1j0i8i30k1.kjDV6DeEVkk&quot;&gt;approximately 700,000 voters &lt;/a&gt; each, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9799/2971&quot;&gt;3,141 counties and county equivalents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that you will have to keep in mind is cost because the more you spend on basics (IE. website, lists, and services) the more you will have to raise before you can spend on advocacy. So it is best to start locally and grow from there, but no matter what the scale of the organization is you will first need is a Website to be your digital outreach base for your political or advocacy campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-up-and-running&quot;&gt;Getting Up and Running&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you will need is a website to bass your digital campaign outreach from. The website doesn’t have to be complicated it can be a simple static website hosted for free by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, but should &lt;strong&gt;include email sign up, donate, and a blog for your content&lt;/strong&gt;. It will also help if you familiarize yourself with a Spread Sheet program because this will be how you will organize your data (. IE volunteers, social media IDs, donor records) at the beginning of your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;thing-to-keep-in-mind&quot;&gt;Thing to Keep in Mind&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may seem easier to use an all-in one system like NationBuilder the problem is that most of the tools are ad-ones, and the ones that aren’t have free equivalents like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meshfire.com/&quot;&gt;MeshFire&lt;/a&gt; for social media listening tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to keep in mind is that pivot tables are a strong tool that are included in spreadsheet programs and can handle the volume of data you will have at the beginning. So make sure that you know the full cost before you start with an all-in one service because it can add unnecessary cost to you campaign in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-one&quot;&gt;Step One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first thing you will need to do is obtain a &lt;a href=&quot;../domain-name/&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; the best place to start is &lt;a href=&quot;http://domains.google/&quot;&gt;Google Domain&lt;/a&gt; because places like GoDaddy will buy the domain name that you search for through their website forcing you to use them. &lt;strong&gt;Once you have the domain name make sure to claim it on every social media account&lt;/strong&gt; from Facebook to GitHub any anything else you can think of. This step is to make sure that people don’t assume your organization identity on a platform you don’t use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;website-basics&quot;&gt;Website Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic cost of a website depends on how much you are willing to do yourself. The cheapest option will be creating a static website for the landing page, and use a Static Site Generator like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to maintain a blog. While this way is by far the cheapest you will need to know how to build a simple website, and be able to integrate some third party services. Another option is to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; site. The biggest benefit of this solution is that you don’t need to know anything about a website. This is because every web host has 1 click WordPress set-up, and there is plenty of theme market place like &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/&quot;&gt;Themeforest&lt;/a&gt; that have non-for profit and campaign web themes. The biggest problem is cost because while you can host a WordPress site for $5 per month it will crash the moment you go viral, and the only way to avoid the problem is to spend any where from $50 to $250 a month on hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../website-platform/&quot;&gt;Read more about website option here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;digital-campaign-strategy-why-you-need-a-blog&quot;&gt;Digital Campaign Strategy (Why You Need a Blog)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until this point we have talked about having a blog, but haven’t really explained why. The reason why you need a blog is very simple it is the best platform for you to get your voice out, because while Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and SnapChat might have more users they limit your content too much and should be as platforms to promote your content from your blog. Great example of this is every digital facing issue advocacy group like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hrc&quot;&gt;Humans Rights Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. This type of blog based strategy is Content Marketing and is one of the main pillars of digital advocacy campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-create-content&quot;&gt;How to Create Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220587&quot;&gt;Content Is King&lt;/a&gt; is an often said mantra in digital marketing for good reason. &lt;strong&gt;Quality content will drive traffic&lt;/strong&gt;  and help you create a broader organization narrative beyond your mission statement and about page. For an Online Activist Group and Political and Issue Campaign there a 3 types of content that will help your effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Press Release: Should be short and act as announcements for the Organization, such as fundraising number or upcoming event. While a lot of people will copy the text into twitter it is better to link to it with a twitter card, and retweet it multiply time through the day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical: Are either research, or policy on your issue. While reporting on other research or policy initiatives is ok. It is better for you to do original work, which is often a key component to this type of content getting shared.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Narrative: This is a personal story that talks about the effects of not acting on your issue, and should try to create an emotional connection with an uplifting ending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Consumer psychologist Dr Brent Coker from the University of Melbourne has identified four key elements present in viral videos, and revealed four common factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Shareability’ on social media. The video content must make the sharer look good to their peers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Viewers must be able to connect to the content. Activating memories via music and nostalgia are key to getting the audience to connect to the video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Large emotional range. Clips that quickly take the viewer from an emotional low (sadness or unfairness) to an emotional high (joy, love or justice) are more likely to go viral.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‘Frisson’ or primitive feeling of excitement or thrill. There is often a physical response to a viral video, hairs standing on the back of the neck and goosebumps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2016-03-recipe-video-viralresearch-key-ingredients.html&quot;&gt;phys.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the 4 points look at video the first can easily be applied to blogs and depending on what social media platforms you use videos are always an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-content-local&quot;&gt;Keep Content Local&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have decided to keep your effort locally then you will need to make sure that your content is local also. This means focusing less on national news and more about local councils. By writing local you are letting search engines know that your activist organization is for a local cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help the most for what search engines view as local searches some examples of search treated as local are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where to vote on election day&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When does early voting start&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where to volunteer&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and while most people have seen Google answer these questions throughout the Presidential Election they still don’t cover municipal and special elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-media&quot;&gt;Social media&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at what social media platforms to use it is &lt;strong&gt;best to use Facebook plus one other&lt;/strong&gt; to start with, but don’t forget to register your name for every social media platform so no can take it. The major reason for using only 2 platforms to start with is because it is better to do Facebook and SnapChat well compared to be on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, interest, SnapChat, YouTube, and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose for using &lt;strong&gt;social media is to engage with your supporters&lt;/strong&gt; and help your campaign disseminate content from your blog. The best way to do that is to reach out to influencers to share your content with their larger following with the hope they follow your account. The &lt;strong&gt;key goal is to drive traffic to your site&lt;/strong&gt; so the user completes an action like to donate or sign-up for a newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warning-about-twitter&quot;&gt;Warning About Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is one of the best platforms and might have more reach than Facebook given how content can go viral much quicker, and can spread outside of a group more easily. That being said, you are more likely to face trolls and bot driven harassment. When you choose a platform make sure that you have a well thought out &lt;a href=&quot;../social-media-policy/&quot;&gt;social media policy&lt;/a&gt; because on Twitter not knowing who to respond to and how to respond can lead you to causing your problems, and alienating support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;digital-fundraising&quot;&gt;Digital Fundraising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you start fundraising make sure that you are following your state laws for issue and political organizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main tool for digital fundraising will be your email list. While most people think it is social media that assumption is wrong. The ALS Association Ice Bucket Challenge went viral it was the exception most campaigns &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/12/02/458008461/a-click-too-far-why-social-media-isnt-that-great-for-fundraising&quot;&gt;2% of their donation referrals&lt;/a&gt; from social media. The best online examples fundraising through emails are President Donald Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders shows how strong it can be. The key takeaway from both of their campaigns are that you should &lt;strong&gt;ask often and create a sense of urgency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Coming soon Deep Dive into Digital Fundraising&lt;/a&gt;
##### Putting All Together
With your campaign website and social media accounts up and running the last step you will have to do is put it all together. This means that you should start working on content to populate your advocacy site, and try to schedule a set number of post and tweets each week. You will also have to start with your social media outreach to influencers to help get your content to the right people to grow your following in a meaningful way. &lt;strong&gt;Make sure you set clear and achievable goal&lt;/strong&gt; so that you measure the success of each action so you know what works best for your advocacy organization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Static Site CMS with GitHub</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be going over how to create a content management system (CMS) using &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;. This workflow will create a CMS that is built on the Static Site Generator &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. This guide &lt;strong&gt;DOES NOT require Jekyll to be set up or any knowledge of Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-up&quot;&gt;Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text editor we recommended here at Digital Roots is &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; because it comes with a markdown previewer which will allow have a What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor, which is one of the biggest drawbacks to using a static site generator over a traditional CMS like Word Press. It also works well with GitHub Desktops because it will automatically track chances between you version on GitHub and the one saved to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt; and sign-up on the front page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/github-landingpage.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub Landing Page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;github-desktop&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To set up GitHub Desktop go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;desktop.github.com&lt;/a&gt; and download the version for you Operating System (OS)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/github-desktop-landingpage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Landing Page of GitHub Desktop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have GitHub Desktop installed. Return to GitHub and go to the git repository(repo) for you site hosted on GitHub Pages. Todo this enter the site repo in the search, and follow the link to your repo.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/github-nav-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;Navigating to site repository&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/github-search-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nav search results&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reaching the repository you will download the repository to GitHub Desktops&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/github-repository-dowloading.png&quot; alt=&quot;Downloading repository&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;client-editable&quot;&gt;Client Editable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to most static site workflows is that they allow users to edit every file on the site this can cause problems if they edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.css&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt;, and the problems seem to get worse with preprocessors. With GitHub we are able to have control over which files are added, this is because GitHub is primarily used as version control system for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;client-workflow&quot;&gt;Client workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a Fork by going to the button left button title masters&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/fork-in-github-desktop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fork the repository&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To open the Project in Atom right click on the folder in GitHub Desktop&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/open-project-Gitdesktop-atom.png&quot; alt=&quot;opening in atom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a new post in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory and fill out the relevant YAML fields (fields  between &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; at the top of the post), and right click the file in atom to open the markdown preview to see your post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/view-of-atom.png&quot; alt=&quot;View of Atom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have written the post fill in the summary and description in GitHub Desktop and commit&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/github-desktop-commit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Filling out commit in GitHub Desktop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you commit it send a pull request&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Client has followed those steps then the post can be uploaded to the site stoping any mistakes the client might have done due to access to the site files.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twitterbots and Campaigns</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With social media proving itself to be worth an investment and integration at the start of a campaign, there are still a lot of decisions that a campaign will have to make that go beyond a &lt;a href=&quot;../social-media-policy/&quot;&gt;social media policy and strategy&lt;/a&gt;. The decisions that go beyond strategy and policy include paid vs organic outreach and whether or not you are going to use bots to help you with your online presence, which recent research has shown can have a meaningful effect even in some of the largest campaigns. Philip Howard, Professor of Internet Studies at the Oxford Internet Institute, comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘We can’t say who was behind the highly automated pro-Trump accounts but they were purposeful, thoughtful and deliberate about when to release messages, what those messages should be, and what their targets were. We found similarities in the rhythm of the pro-Trump Twitter campaign and that successfully employed by the Leave campaign in the run up to the EU referendum in the UK.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A USC study has also shown the scale of these bots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that Twitter bot accounts produced 3.8 million tweets, or 19 percent of all election tweets for the study’s period. Social bots also accounted for 400,000 of the 2.8 million individual users tweeting about the election, or nearly 15 percent of the population under study.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USC study goes further than just the presence of bots and looks at the sentiment of each message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;on a scale ranging from minus 4 (maximum negativity) to plus 4 (maximum positivity), generated by both bot and human tweets during this time. Both human and bot tweets about Trump were almost uniformly positive when compared to those about Clinton, which were equally neutral and positive.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though President-Elect Donald Trump was having a large amount of negative news in print and on television it seems that having a uniformly positive message on twitter. This helped balance the message that was being driven offline, and in contrast, Hillary Clinton had a twitter army that was a lot more balanced. The difference here can create a stark difference given bits are a large driver of online discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bots produce content automatically, and therefore at a very fast and continuous rate. That means they form consistent and pervasive parts of the online discussion throughout the campaign. As a result, they were able to build significant influence, collecting large numbers of followers and having their tweets retweeted by thousands of humans.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constant presence along with a large number of followers is what gives beats the ability to be empowered by the “illusory truth effect”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Psychological research, including my own, shows that repeated exposure to false information can change people’s beliefs that is it true. This phenomenon is called the “illusory truth effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This effect happens to us all – including people who know the truth. Our research suggests that even people who knew Pope Francis made no presidential endorsement would be susceptible to believing a “Pope endorses Trump” headline when they had seen it multiple times. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While twitter bots have been attributed in having an effect on an election, there still isn’t much data to know if there is any real impact, but thanks to the Python Library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/esdalmaijer/markovbot&quot;&gt;Markovbot&lt;/a&gt; it is possible to set-up and try for both local and state based races. The only things you keep in mind are: 1. What kind of bot will do(ie. retweet, post new content, respond other members) 2. what will be your keywords, target string an conversation depth 3. When will it start and stop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you set the twitter bolt upright and make sure they have a positive and promoting message for the candidate or organization, then it will have the best opponent to have an impact on the election,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SEO Checklist</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Search Engine Optimization(SEO) is a broad field with technical and creative part. This is a basic check list that should be used to make sure you have done the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-pagetechnical&quot;&gt;On-Page/Technical&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-Page and Technical side of SEO is the part that you can do right away, and can be broken down into code and keywords. The basic checklist for On-Page and Technical SEO are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check your &lt;a href=&quot;../SEO-Basics&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; it should be clear if it looks like this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user-agent: *&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Disallow: /&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this tells search engines to ignore your site so the first thing to is remove, remove the backslash (/)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;make sure that you don’t have meat name=”robots” &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;content=&quot;noindex&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; [content value can be anything else] (/blog/robots) but &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;content=&quot;noindex&quot;&lt;/code&gt; tell search engines not to index just like robot.txt&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure that there is no 404 pages with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/&quot;&gt;search console&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/&quot;&gt;Screaming Frog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Title tags should be structured (page title&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;brand name)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;URLs should use hyphens( - ) over underscore( _ ) for spaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;markup-and-speed&quot;&gt;Markup and Speed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page speed is one of the most important parts of a website because studies have shown that most users won’t wait more than 4 seconds. Markup also helps a site have a better social media precinct because of image cards on Facebook and Twitter, and you need schema mark-up for Google Snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;markup-and-structure-data&quot;&gt;Markup and Structure Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;go through &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/&quot;&gt;scheme.org&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure that you are using proper tags&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seoskeptic.com/json-ld-big-day-at-google/&quot;&gt;Google seems to prefer JSON-LD&lt;/a&gt; ,but has said they won’t prioritize one over the other&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Look at APIs to see what you should use (IE. Pinterest need microdata if you have multiple objects on a page)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure that there is an image on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This makes sure that all posts and tweets are fat finger friendly and will stand out in the fields&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If available use tester to make sure that they are working properly&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;optimizing-for-speed&quot;&gt;Optimizing for Speed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure that you use appropriate image size to reduce load time. There is also &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scrset&lt;/code&gt; that allows for a better responsive images.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use GZip to compress files&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This can be done in the .htaccess file&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minify your files(IE. CSS, JS, HTML)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use a Content Deliver System like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure if you use a platform like Wordpress you take the necessary steps to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpbeginner.com/common-wordpress-errors-and-how-to-fix-them/&quot;&gt;avoid any problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contentoff-page&quot;&gt;Content/Off-Page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;content should be above 300 words.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While there is no hard rule for this, but content with 1700 to 3000 words seems to do the best.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Post around 300 words also ranks well, but they are more time sensitive (IE. breaking news)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure that you have outbound link. They act like citations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/Social-Media-Tracker&quot;&gt;content tools&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;http://buzzsumo.com/&quot;&gt;Buzzsumo&lt;/a&gt; to see what content from a sit or on a subject is being shared and where.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outreach&quot;&gt;Outreach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google use links and social media are a measure of popularity and there are a number of things you can do the focus on your social media platform and the links you have going to your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;backlinks&quot;&gt;Backlinks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure if you are a chapter or branch of an organization that you have both outbound links (links going to them) and inbound links (links gong for you).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out to news site that have done articles for you and try to get backlinks from them&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Volunteer Relations System</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Volunteers are the life blood or non-for profits, campaigns, and political parties, and while where and how you recruit them is important keeping motivated and involved not just through the campaign, but in between is important to making sure hat you have the support to make the calls and knock the doors to win. Here at Digital Roots has written about how to &lt;a href=&quot;../recruit/&quot;&gt;identify and manage volunteer&lt;/a&gt;, but we have never talked about how to build a system that will help you retain first time volunteers and keep them through the winter and off cycle slumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-a-program&quot;&gt;The Case for a Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When maintaining volunteers there are a number of challenges that every organization faces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reducing ‘churn’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engaging or growing current volunteering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing loyalty to the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are best faced with a loyalty program because there are a number of advantages over the average volunteers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay active over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More likely to suggest people volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend more time volunteering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-building-the-system&quot;&gt;How to Building the System&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each system will be different in a number of key ways there are some rules of thumbs to make sure that the program is successful. The key parts are broken down into the key element of every loyalty program and the mechanics that make the program function on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loyalty-levers&quot;&gt;Loyalty Levers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rewards&quot;&gt;Rewards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rewards are the backbone of the system and can be the most difficult. The rewards can be done in a few ways, but they revolve around accumulating points so that you can receive an award. The points system can be a as simple as receiving the reward after you reach a certain number of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this is Duncan Donuts were once you acquire 200 points you are automatically issued a coupon for a free drink. Or as complicated as the ones most hotel use where you can exchange points like cash for food drinks and discount rooms. Unlike Duncan Donuts these systems allow for greater choice for the user, and create a more customized experience through the different services. The tradeoff for these systems is that changing the system can cause a friction point with your supporters making it harder to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recognition&quot;&gt;Recognition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is what keeps people engaged in the program this is because it allow the individual to feel like they are making progress by reaching new levels or gathering badges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition though isn’t just a statics it also has to come with benefits that are more constant rather than one time. One of the most common examples is when loyalty program members get a preferred customer hotline. For some organization, it could be an extended early bird special for events and fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relevance&quot;&gt;Relevance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevance is what will help you get new members to join the program. This is by far one of the most important parts of the program because using the program can quickly become irrelevant if you can’t gain and active members that will use your loyalty program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest friction points are the forms to sign-up are too long and ask for for more information then need to start. The thing to remember is that you can always get more information from a member once they are active. The other fiction point of relevance is the rewards while it can be easy to avoid on simpler systems more complex ones will have to figure out what members what and what is relevant to the as their status and use of the program goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-kinds-of-loyalty&quot;&gt;Different Kinds of Loyalty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercenary&lt;/strong&gt; - were they are only loyal because it is the best offer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inertia&lt;/strong&gt; - were they stay in the program because they have already invest money or time(IE. money on a loyalty card)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt; - were they believe in the organization and don’t need to be incentivize to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most volunteers will get involved because they fall under true loyalty, but because there are often multiple organizations that advocate for similar issues we need to create inertia loyalty to try to get volunteers to prioritize our efforts over those of allied organizations, and give them a reason to stay on board after the first event (reduce churn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-part-to-a-program&quot;&gt;Basic Part to a Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 basic parts to every loyalty program, which are the currency, status, enrollment &amp;amp; activation, and partnerships. While most organizations have national, local, and state chapters the ability to do partnerships are limited because of the risk of sharing a volunteer list and the different laws. That is why it is best for organization with multiple levels of organizations should run the program at the state level and allow local branches to join the statewide program directly rather than working in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currency (Points) - This is the most significant decision in creating a loyalty program, and is the major supporter of the loyalty lever Reward. The two parts that need to be addressed is the member and organization side:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Decisions that effect Members:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;How can the currency be earned: It could be for social media activity or for canvassing and phone banking.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;How easy the process is to use them: Does the reward automatically trigger once reaching a certain value or does the person have to spend them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;What is the value of the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Decisions that effect Organization:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Breakage: ‘points’ earned by volunteers but are never used, typically stated as a percentage of the total.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Administrative Cost: annual costs associated with maintaining, and growing the program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reward Cost: financial value of any program award that a consumer receives and uses&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Status - is especially important element of a loyalty program because it creates value beyond the points system and supports the loyalty lever Recognition:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Statues have to mean something: That means the there should a desirable benefit for these “special volunteers”, and should be a continuing benefit unlike currency benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enrollment &amp;amp; Activation - All programs start with enrolling (acquiring) and activating (on-boarding) a new member done well it will support the loyalty lever Relevance. The key points are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make the process simple&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Minimize the information that is “required”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enable enrollment to happen across many channels.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tell them only what they need to get started&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracking-key-performance-indicators-kpi&quot;&gt;Tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPI)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference between private business and non-for profits is the KPIs. In business it is based around how much more a member spends. For non-for profits they could use a program for donations, but it would be better at attracting retaining and mobilizing voters. So the KPIs should be based events, voter contact, and volunteer referred rather than a monetary value or social media engagement (IE. reviews and generated content).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting your KPIs to focus on volunteers will have a larger return because investing in a grassroots program can be a time consuming and labor intensive effort. With a loyalty system is is well built you can reduce voluntary churn between election, allowing you to start more aggressively and spend more time growing from last year progress rather than rebuilding last year team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Maryland GOP | Site Audit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With 2016 over and 2018 being more crucial for Republicans in Maryland than ever I though it might be a good time to look at the Maryland GOP to see how their digital footprint looks. There are 5 part that I will be looking at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indexability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On-Page Ranking Factors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Off-Page Ranking Factors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competitive Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;maryland-republican-party---seo-audit&quot;&gt;Maryland Republican Party - SEO Audit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdgop.org/&quot;&gt;Maryland Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; has done the worst possible thing you can do for Search Engine Optimization and the is having your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalroots.io/blog/robots/&quot;&gt;robot.txt&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;

    User-Angent: *

    Disallow: /

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is telling all crawlers that they are not allowed on the site which keep Search Engines from indexing any pages. In the case of mdgop.org they still index for exact search words and phrases because of sites linking back to it, but it is for from ideal.
There robot.txt should look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
User-Agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /utils/
Disallow: /forms/
Disallow: /users/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, things start to look better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site seems to be fine there are no Robots Meta Tags, but because of the robots.txt the site that is index is a 404 error page. Also, they seem to have XML Sitemap, but don’t have it at in the footer. This is something that should be added because Google recommends it. They do avoid using Flash and JavaScript Navigation, which help the Crawlability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site architecture and performance is another mix bag. While the site architecture is simple and allows for easy access the site take a little over 4 seconds to load which &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/&quot;&gt;can cause problems&lt;/a&gt; they should enable compression, use browser caching, and minify files. On the mobile site they need to increase the size of social links so that they are fat finger friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indexability&quot;&gt;Indexability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;site-and-page-search&quot;&gt;Site and Page search&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalroots.io/blog/robots/&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; mdgop.org does index and has a reported 169 pages indexed, and on mdgop.org page search it shows up in position number one, but no other page shows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brand-search&quot;&gt;Brand Search&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These searches seem to have had a major effect from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalroots.io/blog/robots/&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; because the only mdgop domain that showed when I searched Maryland Republican Party, Maryland GOP and mdgop was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdgop.org/site/lookup.asp?c=9sILJXMCLdJ0H&amp;amp;b=5916197&quot;&gt;mdgop.com&lt;/a&gt; which was in position 5, 8 and 1 respectively but both lead to a 404 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/MDGOP-SERP-Maryland-Republican-Party.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Google SERP for Maryland Republican Party&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, because of Google My Business the Maryland Republican Party does show up on the right in the knowledge panel, but only when you search Maryland Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-page-ranking-factors&quot;&gt;On-Page Ranking Factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;urls&quot;&gt;URLs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdgop.org&quot;&gt;Maryland Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; site has a good url that contains relevant keywords, are short and user friendly, and avoids the most common problems with urls, but should use hyphens( - ) instead of underscores( _ ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Republican Party has regular post, but are lacking in length and have no keywords. Maryland GOP could try to use narrative post about what the party is currently doing in the community and have volunteers talk about how they got involved with the party. They could also answer questions “like where do I vote” and “how to run for office”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;keywords&quot;&gt;Keywords&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current Top 5 Keywords by traffic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Keyword&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Percent of Search Traffic&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1\. republican convention&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;44.97%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2\. maryland republican party&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;15.46%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3\. maryland gop&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;5.75%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;4\. maryland republican primary&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4.53%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;5\. maryland republican delegates&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4.31%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They seem to only be getting traffic from republican subject queries this likely means that they are only drawing in republican voters though search and should try to answer election questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ranking with keywords the most important measures are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drumbeatmarketing.net/marketing-blog/what-is-page-authority&quot;&gt;Page Authority(PA)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shoutmeloud.com/domain-authority.html&quot;&gt;Domain Authority(DA)&lt;/a&gt; mdgop.org is PA: 55/100 DA: 46/100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOP: Volume 300k - 1.5m Difficulty 83 Opportunity 64 Potential 80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 3 sites PA was between 49 - 86 and DA were between 84 - 100 for GOP making it hard to make meaningful gains, and because Google views it as a national keyword trying to use local key-phrases isn’t possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to vote: Volume 11.5k - 30.3l Difficulty 70 Opportunity 52 Potential 67&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 3 sites PA was 60 -71 and DA 57 - 75, but Google treats this a a local search to some degree so while it may be hard to rank nationally if they continue down the local search path it will be one of the easer key-phrases to rank with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to vote in Maryland: Volume 101 - 200 Difficulty 38 Opportunity 46 Potential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 3 site are the same without Maryland added. With Google looking at their query as a local search more this key-phrase will help you with local SEO, and during midterms the election is more likely to drive local searches over nation ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican Beliefs : Volume 4.3k - 6.5k Difficulty 31 Opportunity 64 Potential 72&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top sites Page Authority was between 24 - 25 and Domain Authority was between 22 - 36 for Republican Beliefs and while it has much less volume the ability to rank well for this keyword. It also is a keyword that will fit in naturally with narrative content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;html-markuphttpwwwdigitalrootsioblogseo-basics&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalroots.io/blog/SEO-Basics&quot;&gt;HTML Markup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Republican Party’s HTML Markup is lacking in a number of areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;title-tag&quot;&gt;Title Tag&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The Maryland Republican Party’s site has a good title tag, and uses the proper format they might want to replace the dash (-) with a vertical bar (&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;).&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;meta-description&quot;&gt;Meta Description&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are lacking any Meta Description on all of their pages. One thing that they can add is a general description of each page, and what can be found on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;other-head-tags&quot;&gt;Other &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; Tags&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rest of head&amp;gt; section seems to be in good shape with the exception of the social media tags. The Facebook tag doesn’t have a picture of the landing page and the description for Facebook is “Joe Cluster, Executive Director of the Maryland Republican Party, was recently appointed to the Maryland House of Delegates and is leaving the Party on December 31, 2016. The MDGOP is..” because the ‘og: description’ property should be explicitly provided. For twitter the description is blank causing a similar problem to Facebook and has no picture, which means that they are losing out on making their tweets more fat finger friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;image&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Images has no ALT text this is a huge problem. The best ALT text for the landing page image is “Maryland Republican Governor Larry Hogan Greets excited crowd “. Also try to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scrset&lt;/code&gt; to help with load times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;other-body-tags&quot;&gt;Other Body Tags&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Join Governor Larry Hogan &amp;amp; the Maryland Republican Party to change Maryland for the better!” should be in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. Also they should remove the commit above the header due to Internet Explorer, along with removing the end tag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that has no open element, and the unclosed element &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;off-page-ranking-factors&quot;&gt;Off-Page Ranking Factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the off-page factors are defiantly the strongest part of the website. It has high quality back links from newspapers and government sites, and lacks any spam quality links. The one suggestion I would give them is that try to reach out to influences both locally and nationally through social media. Also, they need to start to focus on Key Performance Indicators like email sign up or RSVP for an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;competitive-analysis-mddemsorg&quot;&gt;Competitive Analysis (mddems.org)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final peace of the Site Audit is to look at Maryland Republican Party main competitor Maryland Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top 5 Keywords by traffic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Keyword&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Percent of Search Traffic&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1\. maryland voter registration&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;15.42%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2\. maryland democratic party&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;13.53%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3\. md party&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;8.27%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;4\. democratic party website&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;5.10%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;5\. maryland democratic delegates&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;3.93%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their keywords seem to be border, and 2 of the keywords are generic searches with Maryland voter registration being their best performing. This is a keyword that the MD GOP should target because it is a basic search for new voters that could be more persuadable. In terms of backlink opportunities there seems to not be any given they are earning them through affiliate organizations and news stories. That being said linking with other GOP groups is something that could benefit The Republicans site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media Strategy</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-social-media-strategy&quot;&gt;What is a Social Media Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Social Media Strategy is becoming a critical part of every political and non-for profits strategy, and unlike other digital strategies your social media strategy is built with a framework and general policy. The first part is the Strategy that will act like a framework that will lay out your key performance indicators (KPI) and the general direction that it will take (IE. platform and activities). The other part is policy and will be the guidelines that will help you adapt you strategy to changing environments on each platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media-policy&quot;&gt;Social Media Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Social Media Policy is by far the most important part of your Social Media Plan because it will be what fills in the strategy, and gives you direction when the unexpected happens. There are three basic points to cover in your Social Media Policy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you respond to people on social media
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The most common way to handle this is to not respond to people on social media because they are most likely to be trolls.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you do respond to people on social media it is best to try to get them off of social media. To do this you can direct them to a press release or direct message them, but you should have guidelines that focus on how fast you respond to people on social media and what type of message do you respond to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you use social media (IE. Repost of campaign material or social media exclusive media). There are pros and cons of both of them, and each campaign will have to decide which one will achieve their goal&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does you staff handle their own social media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one point you should always have is that staffers don’t talk about internal information (IE. voter contact number and canvassing location)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other one that can be important is what they post about politics in general. The rule of thumb here is for staffers to only post what their boss post.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media-strategy&quot;&gt;Social Media Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Media Strategy has 6 different angles in which you can use social media:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reach: Social media helps politicians more effectively reach large numbers of voters in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engagement: Unlike television, radio, and direct mailers, social media allows politicians to actively engage with their potential voters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Share Ideas &amp;amp; Goals: Social media allows politicians to share their beliefs, goals, and accomplishments directly with voters, making them feel more directly involved with the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behind-the-Scenes: Social media allows politicians to give their supporters a behind-the-scenes view of their campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn Digital Followers into Votes: It is one thing to build a large, digital following. It is another to turn those followers into votes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analytics: Social media allows political campaigns to more easily track engagement. “We now track every mention of a Senator, House Representative, or Governor,” said Zachary Green, CEO of 140Elect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sample-social-media-policy--strategy&quot;&gt;Sample Social Media Policy / Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-media-policy-1&quot;&gt;Social Media Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the fast-changing landscape of the Internet and the way voters communicate and obtain information online. &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; departments my consider using social media tools to reach a broader audience. The &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; encourages the use of social media to increase our out reach to communities, where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; has an overriding interest and expectation in deciding what is “spoken” on behalf of the organization on media sites. This policy establishes guidelines the use of personal social media accounts, and official accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; social media related accounts will be subject to approval by office of the communications director&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; website (example.com, example.org, etc.) will remain the organizations primary and predominate internet presences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best, most appropriate &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; use of social media fall into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a way to disseminate time-sensitive information as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a way to promote an event and encourage followers and supporters engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, content posted to &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; social media accounts will also be available on the main website of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, content posted on social media should link back to the &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; main website for in-depth information, forms, or documents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality question that are asked through social media will be respond to with in 24 hours through on or off line channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Quality question is a question that’s about up coming events like time and place, or are about clarifying a statement or position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Poor quality question are accusatory and inflammatory, and will often look to attack your views and start a argument.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All new social media tools proposed for &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; use will be approved by the office of the Technology/Digital Director and the appropriate department’s public information authority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; will whenever necessary will replace any removed content with an explanation of why it was removed and step that have been taken to avoid similar events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; reserves the right to restrict or remove any content that is deemed in violation of this social media policy from staff accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Case studies There is no privacy on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Imagine, if you will, an NPR legal correspondent named Sue Zemencourt. She’s a huge fan of Enormous University’s basketball team and loves to chat online about EU. She posts comments on blogs under the screen name “enormous1.” One day, an equally rabid fan of Gigormous State (“gigormous1”) posts obnoxious comments about EU.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sue snaps. Expletives and insults fly from her fingers on to the webpage. They’re so out-of-line that the blog blocks her from submitting any more comments — and discovers that her i.p. address leads back to NPR. The blog’s host posts that “someone at NPR is using language that the FCC definitely would not approve of” and describes what was said. Things go viral.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The basically good person that she is, Sue publicly acknowledges and apologizes for her mistake. But that doesn’t stop The Daily Show from satirizing about the “NPRNormous Explosion.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Damage done.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be circumspect about your behavior, even when the exchange feels private or anonymous. Even an email to a trusted recipient can be made public, with or without the recipient’s knowledge or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staff should avoid posting partisan political material. They shouldn’t just spread information they should be careful and skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staff shouldn’t comment on issues that &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; are involved in, and any questions about &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; should be directed to the communication department or website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-protection is part of being accountable online. Make sure that you use two stage authentication and strong passwords with all social media accounts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-media-strategy-1&quot;&gt;Social Media Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Media Strategy will be used to target 18-35 year olds thought multiple social platforms. When ever possible create and maintain a open community, and to disseminate information as quickly as possible. The primary goal is to help organize supporters and reach out to hard to reach groups through fan pages, hashtags, and sub reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit: have an on going AMA(Ask Me Anything) to direct question on other platform, and have schedule time for both staff and politician. Allow for volunteer to form a community, and to create and give input about blitz days and other campaign events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter: use Twitter as a new rss feed for new site content and press release. Try to get any interaction to the Website or Reddit whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook: use it as a portal for the website, but keep it up to date with pictures unique to the site and recent events and a current event list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create 2 blog post a week that talk about what the campaign has been up to (IE. events, press mentions, endorsements, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create infographic once a month on issues that are most important to online audience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use listening tools to monitor keywords and content sediment(negative, neutral, or positive)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create hashtags for major event like Blitz Days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Performance Indicators (KPI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main KPI: Will be sign-ups to email list to stay up to date on volunteer, and campaign events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondary KIP: - Share and Upvotes(5+ will create a backlink) - Increase of inbound traffic to main site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one KPI that you should never use is number of users this is because followers have no value if they don’t engage with the campaign through sharing commenting or signing-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;influencers&quot;&gt;Influencers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An influencer is is a member of a community that can help you spread your brand and gain you meaningful followers that will help your KPIs. There are several tools to help you find them and they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://keyhole.co/&quot;&gt;Keyhole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meshfire.com&quot;&gt;Meshfire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; Have a free unlimited option that is some what limited, but are some of the best options out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Media Strategies aren’t like any other strategy you will have for your campaign because of the flex able nature of social media platforms. That is why you should always have a clear list of rules and ethics that will guide you through every situation while making sure that you have clear, measurable, and meaningful goals for your social media strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
