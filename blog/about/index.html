<p>I’m a well-rounded professional with broad skills – a passion for teaching others to succeed and grow with a strong record in creating dynamic and effective campaigns. I’ve managed and trained many motivated and interdisciplinary teams of both volunteers and employees.
I’ve built and managed both grassroots and digital campaigns from the ground up, worn every hat on the rack, and dived to new depths.
Don’t let my variety of experience fool you; this is just a plot to make sure that every one voice in the community is heard and people take back the control of the government one campaign at a time.
I worked with some great conservative from Tom Tancredo and Americans for Prosperity to Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen and Governor Mike Pence.</p>
