        <title>Election Campaigning on Social Media (review)</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While campaigns use Facebook and Twitter differently during the campaign the study found that they don’t stray far from the public conversation in subject matter even why the researchers took into account new issues from social media&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper found that while Twitter and Facebook both serve different purposes in reaching out to voter. With twitter being used to comment and engage on event of the moment (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Election-Campaigning-on-Social-Media/Figure-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure 1 showing social media activity around debates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Facebook was used to engage with known support to rally around an issue that is being pushed by the candidate or to mobilize supporters to the polls, but for both platforms neither strayed far from the public agenda which is still being driven by established media organizations, and the general public as seen in table 3 of the study&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the research shows that even with the rang of social media election those platforms are more of a supplement in line with Press Releases in the case of twitter and direct mail/email in the case of Facebook, and it shows what use to work with getting earned media and m=bilizing voters still holds the same has I had in the past prior to the rise of social media.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Volunteer Voter Contact Formula</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;voter-contact-formula&quot;&gt;Voter Contact Formula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following formulas for voter contact are averages and assume all volunteer labor. The numbers in bold are for budgeting purposes; the actual number may vary depending on a number of factors you should adjust your own budgeting accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Door to Door Canvassing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Door-to-door canvassing assuming every door is knocked or a very dense walk list: average
25 doors per hour; 6 contacts(5 8 contacts) per hour&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Door-to-door canvassing assuming a walk list or more suburban district with less density: average 15 doors per hour; 4 contacts (3 6 contacts) per hour
Phone canvassing&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Predictive Dialing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone IDs straight ID, no persuasion: average 35 dials per hour; 10 contacts (7 - 14 contacts) per hour depending on length of script (assuming non - predictive dialing)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Normal 3 hour calling shift to calculate number of lines needed&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Normal 5 days per week (unless other reasons)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Calling through the list 4x you can expect on average to reach about 45 - 50% of the people. One call you can expect about 15 - 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To calculate a number of dials for repeated calls through the list multiply the original list number by the following factors: 3x call though = 2.25 – 4x call through = 2.5 (e.g. to call through a 1,000 name list 3x = 2,250 dials, assuming bad numbers and contacts are removed after each dial through.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone Persuasion — average 25 dials per hour; 7 contacts (5 - 11 contacts) per hour depending on length of script (assuming non - predictive dialing)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GOTV calling — average 30 dials per hour; 10 contacts per hour, assuming no message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone canvassing – Predictive Dialing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone IDs — average 110 dials per hour; 45 contacts (assuming less than one minute script) per hour&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To calculate number of dials for repeated calls through the list multiply the original list number by the following factors: 3x call though = 2.25 – 4x call through = 2.5&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone Persuasion — average 90 dials per hour; 20 contacts (assuming an average 2.5 minute conversation) per hour&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GOTV calling — average 100 dials per hour; 25 contacts per hour (assuming a 2-minute interactive conversation), assuming no message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropping Literature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropping literature — average 50 houses (30 – 70 houses) per person/per hour shift, depending on turf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteer Recruitment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteer Recruitment calling — average 30 dials per hour; 10 contacts and 3 - 5 volunteers per hour depending on list and task (e.g. canvassing fewer, Persuasion calling fewer, ID calling more, GOTV calling more, dropping literature still more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voter-contact-formulas---doing-the-math&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOTER CONTACT FORMULAS - DOING THE MATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persuasion Phone Calls&lt;/strong&gt;: Assume that you are asked to make 5000 persuasion calls in 5 days. You will need 14 volunteers, each working a 3 - hour shift and 14 phone lines to call the list one time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Assume you do not have a predictive dialer. For volunteer persuasion calls, assume you can make 25 Dials per hour/per phone line. Divide to figure out how many hours it will take to make the calls. 5000 attempted contacts ÷ 25 dials per hour = 200 hours&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Divide by 5 days (the number of days you have to call)&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;= 40 calling hours per day&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To figure out how many phone lines, determine how many hours per line you will be calling. If you assume you will have 3-hour shifts, then divide to determine how many lines per day you will need (and how many volunteers per day you will need).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;40 calling hours per day ÷ 3 hours per shift = 13.3 shifts (14) per day. You will, therefore, need 14 phone lines and 14 volunteers per day to make 5000 persuasion calls in 5 days.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To figure out how many actual contacts you will make, assume a 25% contact rate (based on calling through the list one time). You can expect at the end of five days to have made &lt;strong&gt;1,250 actual contacts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To figure out how many names and volunteers you would need to make 5000 contacts do the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5000 contacts ÷ 50% contact rate (based on calling the list through 4 times) = 10,000 names/numbers to start with&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10,000 x 2.5 (the factor for the number of dials to call though 4x) = 25,000 dials.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;25,000 ÷ 25 = 1000 hours&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;= 200 calling hours per day&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;= 67 shifts and volunteers&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To figure out how long it would take to call one time through the list of 5,000 names using a predictive dialer.
5000 attempted contacts ÷ 90 dials per hour = 56 hours
= 11 calling hours per day
= 4 stations and volunteer shifts&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To figure out how to make 5,000 contacts using a predictive dialer.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;5000 contacts ÷ 20 contacts per hour = 250 calling hours
= 50 hours per day
= 14 shifts per day&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Door - to - Door Canvassing&lt;/strong&gt; Assume that you are asked to knock 3600 households of targeted voters in a dense urban district (although not every house will be knocked). You want to know how many volunteers you will need to knock it in ten days. To knock this number of houses in 10 days you will need 5 volunteers per day for 10 days, each person working a 3-hour shift. You will make approximately 864 contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start with 3600 households. To calculate how many hours it will take:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;3600 HH ÷ 25 doors knocked per hour = 144 hours&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To calculate the number of volunteers you need to determine how long a shift will be:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;144 hours ÷ 3 hour shifts = 48 shifts (or volunteers)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;48 shifts (volunteers) ÷ 10 days = 4.8 (5) shifts (volunteers) per day&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To calculate the number of contacts:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;144 hours x 6 contacts per hour = 864 contacts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOTV Calling&lt;/strong&gt;.Assume that you are asked to make 3000 GOTV calls on Monday as part of a GOTV effort. You will need 9 lines and 34 volunteers calling in 3-hour shifts over 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For calculation purposes, assume that you will contact all 3000 with a message or direct contact (since they have already been contacted in some way).
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;3000 GOTV calls ÷ 30 calls per hour = 100 hours calling hours&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume that you will be calling Monday 9 am - 9 pm = 12 hours. To determine how many phone lines are needed, divide the total number of calling hours needed to complete the calls by the total number of hours available to make the calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100 hours calling hours needed ÷ 12 hours total to call = 8.5 (9) lines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the number of volunteers needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100 calling hours ÷ 3 hours shifts = 33.3 (34) volunteer shifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that not every phone line has to be filled at every moment, but that a full 33 shifts need to be filled over the 12 hour day&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Check List for Yard Signs</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think yard signs are a &lt;a href=&quot;../problem-with-yard-signs/&quot;&gt;bad idea&lt;/a&gt; if you do what to use yard signs then this is a simple check list so you at least make less worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many yard signs will be necessary to blanket your district?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will you use large wooden signs, small signs, a combination of both?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you do choose to use smaller signs look at using cardboard they are a little more expensive but are the easiest to put together.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will you put up signs in the primary (whether or not you have a primary opponent)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When will you put up your signs during the primary and general election?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a trickier question than one might at first think. 4x4 wooden signs driven into the ground by metal stakes should probably go up as early as possible in the campaign which is about 45 days out. However, the smaller paper signs are not durable enough usually to last 45 days of weather and in addition, they get stolen by kids and opponents more frequently depending on where you live.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What information is absolutely necessary to put on your yard sign?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Too often, candidates try to put too much information on their yard signs. Generally, people only look at yard signs for a split second as they are driving and don’t have time to see much more than the name. Unfortunately, I have known many starting candidates who believed that the yard sign was the appropriate place to educate voters as to first name, middle initial, last name, nickname, the office being sought. District number, party affiliation and who knows what else. The key is to have your last name as big as possible, use upper and lower case letters and keep other information to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are you going to develop your yard sign lists?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This can be done in several ways. First, contact all your friends and relatives that live in your district or near your district on main roads. Second, check with other candidates in the area for their yard sign lists. Third, distribute volunteer cards at all your events, and Republican events to gain yard sign locations. Fourth, do a mailing with a volunteer card, to all Republicans that voted in the ‘90 election, or the last school board election.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>How to Recruit a Grassroots Army</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Democrats routinely field more effective volunteer armies than Republicans, largely due to the help of their allies in organized labor. But Democrats have also had more success building grassroots organizations because they’re often better at communicating with and organizing their base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the 2010 midterms, when GOP voter enthusiasm was supposed to have been at a 15-year high, campaign staffers across the country were at a loss as to how to get enough unpaid boots on the ground. As the 2016 cycle ramps up, down-ballot candidates—particularly in the early states—face the added challenge of competing for volunteers with over a half a dozen presidential campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some campaign managers may simply throw up their hands and hire paid workers rather than recruit volunteers. But don’t put out the call for resumes before spending some real time trying to build a homegrown volunteer effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my observation, volunteers tend to fall into five distinct categories, which I’ve developed into five “clinical case studies.” Using these in your volunteer recruiting process should help identify the right volunteers for your campaign and help you manage and retain them once they join your political campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-the-loyal-foot-soldier&quot;&gt;1 The loyal foot soldier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: The foot soldier is the Republican version of the Democratic union faithful. These are the tried-and-true volunteers that turn out every election cycle. Their stomping grounds are county GOP meetings, civic organizations (think Rotary, Kiwanis), VFW halls and trade associations. Common varieties include middle-aged local businessmen, grannies who could stuff envelopes with their eyes closed and wiry old veterans with their phone-dialing fingers at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: Good foot soldiers are worth their weight in gold. They’ve been there, done this, so they understand what volunteer duties consist of and won’t get bored or require constant attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: They’ve seen campaigns, and campaign hacks, come and go, and are usually not shy about expressing their opinion of your operation. To retain these volunteers, it’s important to present a competent and professional front. Also, as they trend older, they occasionally resist new technology, so they may need some coaxing to get comfortable with innovations like VoIP phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: Cherish your foot soldiers. Let them do their preferred task, and rest in the knowledge that they will do it well. Use them to train other volunteers in their age range, and reward them with campaign merchandise, they probably collect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-groupie&quot;&gt;2 The groupie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: These volunteers are all about your candidate. They either have some personal connection to him or her or, on a larger race, they might just be a big fan. The thrill of being around the candidate, and the idea that they are making a difference for him or her, is the driving force behind their involvement in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: Groupies will literally walk over hot coals for your candidate. You can’t instill that kind of devotion in anyone else, paid or volunteer. As long as these volunteers believe that what they are doing is the best way they can help the candidate, they will do just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: Because they are so invested in the candidate, often on a personal level, groupies tend to rank relatively high on the high maintenance scale. They can also be fiercely critical if they feel that the campaign is putting their candidate at risk, such as by releasing a negative TV advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: You know what they want, so give it to them. These are the ideal volunteers for visibility and crowd building at events, walking in parades and handing out literature at fairs. The caveat here is that these volunteers need to be well trained, or well supervised, so they understand what they are there to do and don’t spend the entire event trying to chat up the candidate. Still, once the event is over, make sure they get rewarded with a personal thank you, and get a photo-op sometime along the campaign trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-the-architect-in-his-own-mind&quot;&gt;3 The architect (in his own mind)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: This Karl Rove wannabe is the consummate political junkie that desperately wants to be on the staff. He’s typically convinced himself that if he were in charge, the campaign would be on a straight path to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: There aren’t many. They probably know all the insider terminology and will employ industry terms like “micro-targeting” unnecessarily in conversation. If they are local, they may have a body of knowledge on past races and major players that could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: Architects view themselves as strategists, not grunt workers, so they are generally long on advice and short on actual help. Because they put themselves before the campaign, it is difficult to get them to be team players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: Pair them up with a tolerant fellow volunteer and a GPS device and let them drive and pontificate while their partner knocks on doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-the-eager-beaver&quot;&gt;4 The eager beaver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: The eager beaver is the loyal foot soldier without the experience. Generally high school or college kids, these volunteers are enthusiastic and all about helping the cause in any way they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: Eager beavers are energetic, personable and open to instruction. They will likely be thrilled just to be a part of the campaign and are willing to do anything asked of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: With all teenagers, the tendency to be flaky goes with the territory. As a result, they will occasionally no-show when club meetings, sports practice and trouble borrowing the car get in the way. Eager beavers tend to glamorize the staff, so they can be pesky. But at the end of the day, it’s worth spending five minutes of your time chatting them up if it results in 500 phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: Although they require a bit more time and effort on your part, these volunteers will be among your best. Try to recruit them early by staking out local college campuses or posting on social networking sites, and then get them to recruit their friends. Eager beavers tend to be friendly and outgoing, so they’re great for direct voter contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-the-resume-builder&quot;&gt;5 The resume builder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: The resume builder is often similar in age and outward appearance to the eager beaver, but is involved with the campaign for an entirely different reason. He or she is in it primarily to pad their resume. Generally, college kids or recent graduates, resume builders are typically competent and tend to be comparatively reliable since they are looking to get a recommendation for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: The resume builders are easy to understand because their motivation is clear. Agree with it or not, you know what they’re in it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: Resume builders’ self-interested approach will be off-putting to true-believer types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: Make it clear what’s in it for them, and they will do what you need to be done. Resume builders are all about the bottom line. If they seem dissatisfied with the work they’re doing, offer them a title promotion to sweeten the deal. They will generally clean toilets as long as they get to put deputy something-or-other on their resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each volunteer is obviously a unique individual, but many of them can be categorized. The sooner you figure out what they’re looking to get out of the experience, the easier it will be to develop the tools to get what you need out of them. After all, if your campaign can’t motivate people who are already supporters, how can you expect to influence voters?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media Strategy</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-social-media-strategy&quot;&gt;What is a Social Media Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Social Media Strategy is becoming a critical part of every political and non-for profits strategy, and unlike other digital strategies, your social media strategy is built with a framework and general policy. The first part is the Strategy that will act like a framework that will lay out your key performance indicators (KPI) and the general direction that it will take (IE. platform and activities). The other part is policy and will be the guidelines that will help you adapt your strategy to changing environments on each platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media-policy&quot;&gt;Social Media Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Social Media Policy is by far the most important part of your Social Media Plan because it will be what fills in the strategy, and gives you direction when the unexpected happens. There are three basic points to cover in your Social Media Policy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you respond to people on social media
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The most common way to handle this is to not respond to people on social media because they are most likely to be trolls.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you do respond to people on social media it is best to try to get them off of social media. To do this you can direct them to a press release or direct message them, but you should have guidelines that focus on how fast you respond to people on social media and what type of message do you respond to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you use social media (IE. Repost of campaign material or social media exclusive media)? There are pros and cons of both of them, and each campaign will have to decide which one will achieve their goal&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you staff handle their own social media?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one point you should always have is that staffers don’t talk about internal information (IE. voter contact number and canvassing location)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other one that can be important is what they post about politics in general. The rule of thumb here is for staffers to only post what their boss post.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media-strategy&quot;&gt;Social Media Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Media Strategy has 6 different angles in which you can use social media:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reach: Social media helps politicians more effectively reach large numbers of voters in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engagement: Unlike television, radio, and direct mailers, social media allow politicians to actively engage with their potential voters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Share Ideas &amp;amp; Goals: Social media allows politicians to share their beliefs, goals, and accomplishments directly with voters, making them feel more directly involved with the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behind-the-Scenes: Social media allows politicians to give their supporters a behind-the-scenes view of their campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn Digital Followers into Votes: It is one thing to build a large, digital following. It is another to turn those followers into votes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analytics: Social media allows political campaigns to more easily track engagement. “We now track every mention of a Senator, House Representative, or Governor,” said Zachary Green, CEO of 140Elect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sample-social-media-policy--strategy&quot;&gt;Sample Social Media Policy / Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-media-policy-1&quot;&gt;Social Media Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the fast-changing landscape of the Internet and the way voters communicate and obtain information online. &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; departments may consider using social media tools to reach a broader audience. The &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; encourages the use of social media to increase our outreach to communities, where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; has an overriding interest and expectation in deciding what is “spoken” on behalf of the organization on media sites. This policy establishes guidelines the use of personal social media accounts, and official accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; social media related accounts will be subject to approval by office of the communications director&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; website (example.com, example.org, etc.) will remain the organizations primary and predominate internet presences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best, most appropriate &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; use of social media fall into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a way to disseminate time-sensitive information as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a way to promote an event and encourage followers and supporters engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, content posted to &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; social media accounts will also be available on the main website of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, content posted on social media should link back to the &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; main website for in-depth information, forms, or documents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The quality question that is asked through social media will respond to within 24 hours through on or offline channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Quality question is a question that’s about upcoming events like time and place, or are about clarifying a statement or position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Poor quality question is accusatory and inflammatory, and will often look to attack your views and start an argument.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All new social media tools proposed for &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; use will be approved by the office of the Technology/Digital Director and the appropriate department’s public information authority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; will whenever necessary will replace any removed content with an explanation of why it was removed and step that have been taken to avoid similar events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; reserves the right to restrict or remove any content that is deemed in violation of this social media policy from staff accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Case studies There is no privacy on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Imagine, if you will, an NPR legal correspondent named Sue Zemencourt. She’s a huge fan of Enormous University’s basketball team and loves to chat online about EU. She posts comments on blogs under the screen name “enormous1.” One day, an equally rabid fan of Gigormous State (“gigormous1”) posts obnoxious comments about EU.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sue snaps. Expletives and insults fly from her fingers onto the web page. They’re so out-of-line that the blog blocks her from submitting any more comments — and discovers that her i.p. address leads back to NPR. The blog’s host posts that “someone at NPR is using language that the FCC definitely would not approve of” and describes what was said. Things go viral.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The basically good person that she is, Sue publicly acknowledges and apologizes for her mistake. But that doesn’t stop The Daily Show from satirizing about the “NPRNormous Explosion.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Damage done.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be circumspect about your behavior, even when the exchange feels private or anonymous. Even an email to a trusted recipient can be made public, with or without the recipient’s knowledge or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staff should avoid posting partisan political material. They shouldn’t just spread information they should be careful and skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staff shouldn’t comment on issues that &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; are involved in, and any questions about &lt;strong&gt;[ORGANIZATION]&lt;/strong&gt; should be directed to the communication department or website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-protection is part of being accountable online. Make sure that you use two-stage authentication and strong passwords with all social media accounts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-media-strategy-1&quot;&gt;Social Media Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Media Strategy will be used to target 18-35-year-olds thought multiple social platforms. Whenever possible create and maintain an open community, and to disseminate information as quickly as possible. The primary goal is to help organize supporters and reach out to hard to reach groups through fan pages, hashtags, and subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit have an ongoing AMA(Ask Me Anything) to direct question on another platform, and have scheduled time for both staff and politician. Allow for the volunteers to form a community, and to create and give input about blitz days and other campaign events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter: use Twitter as a new RSS feed for new site content and press release. Try to get any interaction to the Website or Reddit whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook: use it as a portal for the website, but keep it up to date with pictures unique to the site and recent events and a current event list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create 2 blog post a week that talk about what the campaign has been up to (IE. events, press mentions, endorsements, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create infographic once a month on issues that are most important to an online audience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use listening tools to monitor keywords and content sediment(negative, neutral, or positive)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create hashtags for the major event like Blitz Days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Performance Indicators (KPI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main KPI: Will be sign-ups to an email list to stay up to date on volunteer, and campaign events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondary KIP: - Share and Upvotes(5+ will create a backlink) - Increase of inbound traffic to the main site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one KPI that you should never use is a number of users this is because followers have no value if they don’t engage with the campaign through sharing commenting or signing-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;influencers&quot;&gt;Influencers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An influencer is a member of a community that can help you spread your brand and gain you meaningful followers that will help your KPIs. There are several tools to help you find them and they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://buzzsumo.com&quot;&gt;Buzzsumo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://keyhole.co/&quot;&gt;Keyhole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Social-Media-Tracker/&quot;&gt;More Tools for Social Media Tracking and Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meshfire.com&quot;&gt;Meshfire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;(shut down)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; Have a free unlimited option that is somewhat limited but is some of the best options out there.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Media Strategies aren’t like any other strategy you will have for your campaign because of the flex-able nature of social media platforms. That is why you should always have a clear list of rules and ethics that will guide you through every situation while making sure that you have clear, measurable, and meaningful goals for your social media strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starting a Political Action Committee</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A Political Action Committee (PAC) is often the best way to make a difference in politics. In this post we will go over the key differences between the two most common PACs, and an overview of the steps you will need to take to start and terminate a Nonconnected PAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;separate-segregated-funds&quot;&gt;Separate Segregated Funds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Corporations and labor organizations can’t contribute to federal candidates. They can establish and administer a special kind of political committee: the separate segregated fund (SSF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An SSF can raise funds to make contributions to candidates — including expenditures that are coordinated with candidates — within the applicable contribution limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can set up an SSF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corporations (including those without capital stock)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labor organizations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incorporated membership organizations (including trade associations)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;National banks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incorporated cooperatives&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sponsoring corporation or labor organization is called the SSF’s “connected organization.” The connected organization can use its own money to solicit contributions to the SSF and to pay the costs of establishing and operating the SSF, for example staff salaries and office space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSFs may solicit contributions only from a limited group of people, including the connected organization’s executive or administrative personnel, its stockholders (if the connected organization is a corporation), or its members (if the connected organization is a labor organization or a membership organization).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nonconnected-committees&quot;&gt;Nonconnected Committees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to set up a Political Action Committee (PAC) — and your PAC is not a political party committee, a candidate’s authorized committee or a separate segregated fund (SSF) established by a corporation or labor organization — you can set up a “nonconnected” committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of congress and other political leaders often establish nonconnected committees, usually called Leadership PACs. Leadership PACs usually support candidates for various federal or nonfederal offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super PACs and Hybrid PACs are another type of nonconnected committee. These committees must register and report all of their receipts and disbursements. If you are setting up a Super PAC or a Hybrid PAC, find more information on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/ans/answers_pac.shtml#super_hybrid&quot;&gt;FEC.gov quick answers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;essentials-for-nonconnected-committees&quot;&gt;Essentials for nonconnected committees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;registration&quot;&gt;Registration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;getting-a-tax-id-and-bank-account&quot;&gt;Getting a tax ID and bank account&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political committees must establish a bank account. This is required for many reasons, including helping keep committee funds separate from personal funds. You’ll use this account to deposit receipts and make disbursements. The account must be at one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;National bank&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;State bank&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FDIC- or NCUA-insured institution&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll list the name and address of the bank on the authorized committee’s Statement of Organization (Form 1).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banks require you to have a taxpayer identification number to open an account. Get your “Employer Identification Number” online or by completing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss4.pdf?portlet=3&quot;&gt;IRS Form SS-4&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions about obtaining a taxpayer identification number, call the Internal Revenue Service, 1-800-829-3676.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;getting-a-treasurer&quot;&gt;Getting a treasurer&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every political committee must designate a treasurer before it can accept contributions or make expenditures. Designate your treasurer on your Statement of Organization (Form 1).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treasurers must ensure committee reports and statements are complete, accurate and timely. This is a significant responsibility— if there’s an enforcement action against a committee, the treasurer is usually named as a respondent. Treasurers can be found officially (or, in some circumstances, personally) liable for the actions they take.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treasurer responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sign and file all committee reports and statements.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Deposit receipts in the committee’s designated bank within 10 days of receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Authorize expenditures or appoint someone else (orally or in writing) to authorize expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Monitor contributions, ensuring they comply with legal limits and prohibitions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep records of receipts and disbursements for three years from the filing date of the report to which they relate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A candidate can choose to act as his or her own committee treasurer.
Assistant treasurer&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A committee can’t raise or spend money unless it has a treasurer. For that reason, the FEC urges every committee to designate an assistant treasurer on its Statement of Organization. If the treasurer resigns or is unavailable, the assistant treasurer can perform any of the duties listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assistant treasurer should be aware of all filing requirements and have access to the committee’s electronic filing password, if the committee files electronically.
Changing treasurers&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Committees must report a change in treasurer within 10 days of the change. Most do this by filing an amended Statement of Organization. This amended form designates (and is signed by) the new treasurer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treasurers can also resign by informing the FEC directly by letter or — in the case of electronic filers — by Form 99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;registering-a-nonconnected-committee&quot;&gt;Registering a nonconnected committee&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must register your nonconnected committee within 10 days of raising or spending more than $1,000 in contributions or expenditures during a calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Register by filing a Statement of Organization (Form 1) with the FEC. The Statement of Organization collects some basic information, including the full name of your nonconnected committee, your address and your treasurer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the information you disclosed on your Statement of Organization ever changes, you must report that change within 10 days. Do this by filing an amended Statement of Organization. If your nonconnected committee isn’t an electronic filer, you may update your Statement of Organization by letter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Statement of Organization is available in the following options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webforms.fec.gov/webforms/form1/index.htm&quot;&gt;Web form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-file&quot;&gt;How to File&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some committees are required to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/elecfil/ef_overview.shtml&quot;&gt;file electronically&lt;/a&gt;. All other committees can choose whether to file electronically or by paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/elecfil/ef_overview.shtml&quot;&gt;Electronic filing&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/elecfil/software.shtml&quot;&gt;Filing Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Filing&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When filing by paper, your committee can use first-class mail, hand delivery or overnight mail options.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Always retain proof of mailing and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-class mail or hand delivery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;If you use first-class mail or hand delivery, your reports must be received by close of business on the filing deadline. If the filing deadline falls on a weekend or federal holiday, your report must be received by the close of business on the last business day before the filing deadline.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overnight mail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;“Overnight mail” means registered mail, certified mail, Priority or Priority Express mail (with delivery confirmation) or overnight delivery service (with online tracking)— if you use one of these methods, your reports must be postmarked by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the filing deadline, unless the report is a pre-primary or a pre-general report.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-primary and pre-general reports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Pre-primary and pre-general reports must be received by close of business on the filing deadline if sent by first-class mail or hand delivery. They must be postmarked by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time three days before the filing deadline if sent by one of the “overnight mail” options.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Postal deliveries to the FEC:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;999 E Street, NW&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Washington, DC 20463&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regular-filing&quot;&gt;Regular Filing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;know-your-filing-requirements&quot;&gt;Know your filing requirements&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After registration, your nonconnected committee must file regular reports with the FEC until you request to terminate and that request is approved by the FEC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonconnected committee filing requirements differ in election and non-election years. Election years are even-numbered years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you review required documents, you may notice that some forms are offered as both a web form and a PDF. With the exception of mandatory electronic filers, nonconnected committees can choose whether to file electronically or by paper.  If a committee voluntarily files electronically, it must continue to do so for the remainder of the calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;election-years&quot;&gt;Election years&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In election years, your nonconnected committee can choose to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/info/filing.shtml&quot;&gt;file either quarterly or monthly&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to switch your committee’s filing frequency, you can do this only once per calendar year, and your treasurer must notify the FEC. Send the notification along with a report filed under your current filing schedule, on paper or electronically, whichever is your regular method of filing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Independent expenditures&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In some circumstances, your nonconnected committee may need to file specific and separate reports of independent expenditures. These are called 24- and 48-Hour Reports.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about Independent Expenditure reporting follow this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/indexp.shtml&quot;&gt;link to the FEC.gov section&lt;/a&gt; on Coordinated Communications and Independent Expenditures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;non-election-years&quot;&gt;Non-election years&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your nonconnected committee &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/info/filing.shtml&quot;&gt;files quarterly&lt;/a&gt; in election years, you’ll automatically switch to semi-annual reporting in non-election years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your committee &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/info/filing.shtml&quot;&gt;files monthly&lt;/a&gt; in election years, you’ll keep filing monthly in non-election years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to switch filing frequency from monthly to quarterly or vice versa, you can do this only once per calendar year, and your treasurer must notify the FEC. Send the notification along with a report filed under your current filing schedule, on paper or electronically, whichever is your regular method of filing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other filing requirements may also apply if your committee is active in a special election.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;terminating-a-committee&quot;&gt;Terminating a committee&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you decide to close down your committee operations, you must file a termination report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can file a termination report when your committee meets all of these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You no longer receive (or intend to receive) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You no longer make (or intend to make) expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use your regular campaign finance disclosure form to file the termination report (Form 3, 3X or 3P). Check the “Termination Report” box on line 4 of that form’s cover page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, you can combine your termination report with an already scheduled filing by checking the “Termination Report” box on your May monthly report. However, your termination report must include the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All receipts and disbursements not previously reported. This includes your accounting of any debt retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How you will use any remaining committee funds and assets.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your committee is involved in an FEC enforcement action, audit or litigation, you cannot terminate your committee. You must file regularly until that matter is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the FEC notifies you that it has accepted your termination report, you can stop filing regular campaign finance disclosure reports with the FEC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t stop filing just because you checked the “Termination Report” box on your regular campaign finance disclosure form. You must file regularly scheduled reports until the Commission notifies you in writing that it has granted your request to terminate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;missed-deadline&quot;&gt;Missed deadline&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The FEC doesn’t have the authority to give deadline extensions. If you miss a filing deadline, you may be referred to their Administrative Fine Program. File your report as soon as you realize you’ve missed a deadline. Contact the FEC with questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Volunteer Relations System</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summery&quot;&gt;Summery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the election year coming grassroots programs will start to launch and with every program the heart and soul of the grassroots program is volunteer so by creating a volunteer relations system you will be able to build and maintain a volunteer team that will be there for you from your first blitz day to your final GOTV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-have-a-volunteer-retention-system&quot;&gt;Why should you have a volunteer retention system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteers are the lifeblood or non-for profits, campaigns, and political parties, and while where and how you recruit them is important keeping motivated and involved not just through the campaign, but in between is important to make sure that you have the support to make the calls and knock the doors to win. Here at Digital Roots we have written about how to &lt;a href=&quot;../recruit/&quot;&gt;identify and manage volunteer&lt;/a&gt;, but we have never talked about how to build a system that will help you retain first-time volunteers and keep them through the winter and off cycle slumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-a-program&quot;&gt;The Case for a Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When maintaining volunteers there are a number of challenges that every organization faces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reducing ‘churn’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engaging or growing current volunteering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing loyalty to the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are best faced with a loyalty program because there are a number of advantages over the average volunteers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay active over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More likely to suggest people volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend more time volunteering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-building-the-system&quot;&gt;How to Building the System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each system will be different in a number of key ways there are some rules of thumbs to make sure that the program is successful. The key parts are broken down into the key element of every loyalty program and the mechanics that make the program function on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loyalty-levers&quot;&gt;Loyalty Levers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rewards&quot;&gt;Rewards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rewards are the backbone of the system and can be the most difficult. The rewards can be done in a few ways, but they revolve around accumulating points so that you can receive an award. The points system can be a as simple as receiving the reward after you reach a certain number of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this is Duncan Donuts were once you acquire 200 points you are automatically issued a coupon for a free drink. Or as complicated as the ones most hotel use where you can exchange points like cash for food drinks and discount rooms. Unlike Duncan Donuts these systems allow for greater choice for the user and create a more customized experience through the different services. The tradeoff for these systems is that changing the system can cause a friction point with your supporters making it harder to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recognition&quot;&gt;Recognition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is what keeps people engaged in the program this is because it allows the individual to feel like they are making progress by reaching new levels or gathering badges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition though isn’t just a statics it also has to come with benefits that are more constant rather than one time. One of the most common examples is when loyalty program members get a preferred customer hotline. For some organization, it could be an extended early bird special for events and fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relevance&quot;&gt;Relevance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevance is what will help you get new members to join the program. This is by far one of the most important parts of the program because using the program can quickly become irrelevant if you can’t gain and active members that will use your loyalty program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest friction points are the forms to sign-up are too long and ask for more information then need to start. The thing to remember is that you can always get more information from a member once they are active. The other fiction point of relevance is the rewards while it can be easy to avoid on simpler systems more complex ones will have to figure out what members what and what is relevant to the as their status and use of the program goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-kinds-of-loyalty&quot;&gt;Different Kinds of Loyalty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercenary&lt;/strong&gt; - where they are only loyal because it is the best offer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inertia&lt;/strong&gt; - were they stay in the program because they have already invested money or time(IE. money on a loyalty card)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt; - were they believe in the organization and don’t need to be incentivized to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most volunteers will get involved because they fall under true loyalty, but because there are often multiple organizations that advocate for similar issues we need to create inertia loyalty to try to get volunteers to prioritize our efforts over those of allied organizations and give them a reason to stay on board after the first event (reduce churn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-part-to-a-program&quot;&gt;Basic Part to a Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 basic parts to every loyalty program, which are the currency, status, enrollment &amp;amp; activation, and partnerships. While most organizations have national, local, and state chapters the ability to do partnerships are limited because of the risk of sharing a volunteer list and the different laws. That is why it is best for an organization with multiple levels of organizations should run the program at the state level and allow local branches to join the statewide program directly rather than working in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currency (Points) - This is the most significant decision in creating a loyalty program, and is the major supporter of the loyalty lever Reward. The two parts that need to be addressed is the member and organization side:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Decisions that effect Members:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;How can the currency be earned: It could be for social media activity or for canvassing and phone banking.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;How easy the process is to use them: Does the reward automatically trigger once reaching a certain value or does the person have to spend them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;What is the value of the rewards?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Decisions that effect Organization:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Breakage: ‘points’ earned by volunteers but are never used, typically stated as a percentage of the total.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Administrative Cost: annual costs associated with maintaining, and growing the program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reward Cost: financial value of any program award that a consumer receives and uses&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Status - is the especially important element of a loyalty program because it creates value beyond the points system and supports the loyalty lever Recognition:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Statues have to mean something: That means the there should a desirable benefit for these “special volunteers”, and should be a continuing benefit, unlike currency benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enrollment &amp;amp; Activation - All programs start with enrolling (acquiring) and activating (on-boarding) a new member done well it will support the loyalty lever Relevance. The key points are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make the process simple&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Minimize the information that is “required”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enable enrollment to happen across many channels.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tell them only what they need to get started&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracking-key-performance-indicators-kpi&quot;&gt;Tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPI)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference between private business and non-for profits is the KPIs. In business, it is based on how much more a member spends. For non-for profits, they could use a program for donations, but it would be better at attracting retaining and mobilizing voters. So the KPIs should be based events, voter contact, and volunteer referred rather than a monetary value or social media engagement (IE. reviews and generated content).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting your KPIs to focus on volunteers will have a larger return because investing in a grassroots program can be a time consuming and labor intensive effort. With a loyalty system is well built you can reduce voluntary churn between election, allowing you to start more aggressively and spend more time growing from last year progress rather than rebuilding last year team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free Media and Twitter in the 2016 Presidential Election</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter L. Francia looked into one of the leading theories for the stunning victory of President Donald Trump. In Free Media and Twitter in the 2016 Presidential Election: The Unconventional Campaign of Donald Trump Peter L. Francia looks at a number of different datasets to determine if there is validity to the free media thesis, which states Donald Trump was able to surprises pundits and reporters because they looked at traditional metrics and didn’t take into account Trumps earned media. &lt;strong&gt;Peter L. Francia does state that his paper doesn’t prove or disprove the free media thesis but only adds to the body of work examining it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../pdf/Free-Media-Twitter-2016-Presidential-Election.pdf&quot;&gt;View/Download Paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue with the free media theory is that Donald Trump’s earned media had been often more negative than positive, but in his study, Dr. Francia points to a YouGov/Economist poll that illustrated why this wasn’t a major hindrance to Donald Trump profiting off of earned media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Clinton Voters (%)&lt;/th&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;A great deal&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hypothesis&quot;&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Francia sets 5 different Hypothesis to test whether the free media thesis is validated. The hypothesis can be grouped into 2 groups 1 being based on coverage in terms of followers and free media coverage, especially around the crucial months of the campaign, and group 2 which uses polling on how much they saw and who they talked about the 2016 election:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothesis-1&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 1&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump generated more free media coverage, especially during the key months of the election cycle, than did his chief opponent, Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothesis-2&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 2&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump had more followers on Twitter than Hillary Clinton, especially during the key final months of the election cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothesis-3&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 3&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A higher percentage of people reported seeing more social media posts supporting Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothesis-4&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 4&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A higher percentage of people reported seeing more news stories about Donald Trump than about Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothesis-5&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 5&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A higher percentage of people reported that they spent more time talking about Donald Trump in their personal conversations than about Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While he was able to prove all five hypothesis the last three had some issues due to how the data was collected, but both hypotheses, one and two were able to prove which can be seen in table 2 and in the media that have covered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-2016-general-election/&quot;&gt;amount of coverage the candidate had received&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;(40,576,744)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;(72,175,075)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;(45,320,187)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;(61,782,564)&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;(280,233,058)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critique&quot;&gt;Critique&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 3-5 aren’t good indicators to see if the free media thesis could have been the reason for Presidents Trump surprise victory because other research has shown that social media and private conversations about politics are often &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vice.com/story/journalists-and-trump-voters-live-in-separate-online-bubbles-mit-analysis-shows&quot;&gt;self-sorted&lt;/a&gt; which means the people who were talking about politics were talking to people who were like-minded if they were for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/FreeMediaThesis/TwitterData1-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of graph showing political division and segregation on Twitter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, given the negative coverage of Trump during the campaign and after there is a possibility that the polls might not include people who follow both Trump and Clinton, but support Trump because they are less likely to participate in the poll due to negative coverage which looked at in &lt;a href=&quot;../pdf/swing-voters.pdf&quot;&gt;Myth of the Swing Voter&lt;/a&gt;. With the possible nonresponse rates from marginal supports plus small dataset makes the evidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-27/the-economics-data-revolution-has-growing-pains&quot;&gt;more likely to be a false positive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the study of Peter L. Francia has accomplished what he set out to do, which is contributing to the growing evidence of the legitimacy of the free media thesis being a driving factor behind Donald Trump’s surprise victory. Because, as he points out, when proving hypothesis 1 and 2 the value of the earned media and the timing in which it happened could have had a meaningful impact on the election. &lt;strong&gt;The major take away campaigns can use&lt;/strong&gt; is how social media can be used to gain media coverage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/FreeMediaThesis/Path-of-influence.png&quot; alt=&quot;flow chart from the study showing how information reaches voters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, but be warned if you are a local candidate this is not likely to work because federal and statewide officeholders take precedence in the media which means there are better ways to gain media attention.&lt;/p&gt;
