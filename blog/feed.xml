        <title>SEO Crash Course for Beginners</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-seo&quot;&gt;What Is SEO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how Google decides which websites show up at the top of the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) well it is based on of a number of algorithms based off of rank, and optimizing a website is what Search Engine Optimizing (SEO) does through strategies, tactics and techniques. While it might sound simple &lt;strong&gt;Google has over 400 updates a year&lt;/strong&gt; and research and testing are the only ways to stay on top of these updates. There is also the need to understand user intent, though keywords so you can have your content reach your audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To but it simply the SERP is like an iTunes chart of the internet, websites rank higher on the search engines dependent on how ‘good they are’ and SEO is the practice of making them get up there. So when some one searches for “volunteering in my area” the most popular site will be first. SEO tries to get your content above the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making sure the right people find you&lt;/strong&gt; at the right time is what SEO is really all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reason-why-you-need-seo&quot;&gt;Reason Why You Need SEO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imforza.com/blog/8-seo-stats-that-are-hard-to-ignore/&quot;&gt;93% of all online experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; start with search engines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/233459/organic-search-drives-51-of-traffic-paid-search.html&quot;&gt;51% of traffic to business&lt;/a&gt; websites comes from organic search results. Paid search ads only accounted for 10% of traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SEO outranks PPC ads, social media marketing and email marketing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2014/03/26/7-reasons-why-your-business-should-invest-in-seo/#196117661337&quot;&gt;when it comes to ROI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The top organic search result gets &lt;a href=&quot;https://chitika.com/google-positioning-value&quot;&gt;33% of organic traffic&lt;/a&gt;, while only 10% of users make it past the first page of Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So search optimization is really important reaching your audience, and getting them to your site. More importantly though it is what the top site on the internet are doing, and something that will give you an edge and another channel to reach your audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started-with-seo&quot;&gt;Getting Started With SEO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is google your site to make sure all the pages are indexed. To do this &lt;strong&gt;search site:yoursite.com&lt;/strong&gt; and it will show which pages are indexed. Depending on your results there are some simple steps to make sure that every page get indexed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;make-sure-that-google-analytics-ga-and-search-console-are-set-up&quot;&gt;1. Make sure that Google Analytics (GA) and Search Console are set up&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Analytics and Search Console on its own will not help you index your site, but a number of things that we will be using the console and you should always be &lt;strong&gt;tracking users on your website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;look-at-the-robottxt-file&quot;&gt;2. Look at the robot.txt file&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;most common mistake&lt;/strong&gt; that can be made here is having
  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
  User-agnet: *
  Disallow: /
 &lt;/code&gt;
  This tells the Search Engine to not crawl your site because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; means root directory. So by getting rid of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; and using Nonstandard extension &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;allowed:&lt;/code&gt; you will make sure that the search engines will crawl your site.
  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /
  Disallow:
 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;sitemap&quot;&gt;3. Sitemap&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing that you should do is make sure you have a sitemap in both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sitemap.html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sitemap.xml&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sitemap.html&lt;/code&gt; will be added to the footer of each page, while the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sitemap.xml&lt;/code&gt; will be upload in to google search console.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, you will upload your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sitemap.html&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;strong&gt;Search Console&lt;/strong&gt; by going to the left hand menu &lt;strong&gt;Crawl &amp;gt; Sitemaps&lt;/strong&gt; in the upper right side there will be a &lt;strong&gt;ADD/TEST Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt; add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sitemap.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;local-indexing&quot;&gt;4. Local Indexing&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This can only be done if you have a physical location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure that you claim your &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/business/&quot;&gt;Google Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you set it up all you need to do is include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add a long, unique description that’s formatted correctly and includes links.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose the correct categories for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Upload as many photos as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add a local phone number to your listing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add your business address that’s consistent with that on your website and local directories.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Upload a high-resolution profile image and cover photo.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add your opening times/days (if relevant)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make sure that you have your full NAP across your whole website and it has the same details/format.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You will also need Local SEO factors that that help with targeting, and will be discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;/#Technical-SEO&quot;&gt;Technical SEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/#On-Page-SEO&quot;&gt;On-Page SEO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been a lot to do to just get your website ready for SEO Digital Roots has the experience that will make sure that your content will not have any road blocks on it’s way to your audience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keyword-research&quot;&gt;Keyword Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While getting your website index requires &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; make sure it targets your audience is all about content and the keywords that you use. Google is very good at understanding how different word is related thanks to
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which means Google knows flat and apartment are interchangeable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitepoint.com/6-seo-myths-debunked/&quot;&gt;Despite rumors to the contrary&lt;/a&gt;, keywords are still very much relevant to SEO and picking the right keywords to optimize your site around is a critical part of SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most common mistakes&lt;/strong&gt; for Digital Marketing also apply to SEO keyword research:
  - Only doing SEO keyword research once
  - Not updating and expand their SEO keyword Lists
  - Only going for the competitive SEO Keywords leaving gains in other areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing to remember is that Keyword research is an ongoing process, and you have to stay up to date on the best practices for SEO Keyword Research and content strategies. To get started with research start with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner&quot;&gt;AdWord’s Keyword Planner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; while it will give you traffic only ranges which are: 1-100, 100-1k, 1k-10k, 10k-100k, 100k-1M. This gives you an ok idea of what might be worth targeting, but make sure you look at the competition to see if there is any possibility for you to rank in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have a better chance of ranking and reaching your target audience, we use &lt;strong&gt;Long-Tail Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;. A long-tail keyword are more target because they are aiming to answer more specific questions. To start SEO Long-tail Keyword Research we look at the search funnel meaning we see what the &lt;strong&gt;scope of the search results&lt;/strong&gt; ie. Local, State, National. The best tool that I have come across for long-tail keyword research is &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywordtool.io/&quot;&gt;Keyword Tool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keywordspy.com/&quot;&gt;Keyword Spy&lt;/a&gt;, but there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woorank.com/en/blog/free-keyword-research-tools&quot;&gt;several options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;links-1st-or-2nd-most-important-ranking-factor&quot;&gt;Links (1st or 2nd most important ranking factor)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;outbound-links&quot;&gt;Outbound Links&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outbound Links can help you rank better because they work like citations, but make sure you &lt;strong&gt;only have 1-3 outbound links&lt;/strong&gt; because it can seem like a spam quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;inbound-links&quot;&gt;Inbound Links&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inbound Links are the most important&lt;/strong&gt; because they are viewed as a measure of how trustworthy and popular your website is. It also helps with determining what type of website you are and for &lt;strong&gt;Local SEO your location&lt;/strong&gt;. The key is to get likes to point to your website and there are a number of to achieve this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;link-building-techniques&quot;&gt;5 Link Building Techniques&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Micro-sites
    - They are fun and great ways to attract links some time they will even link back to your main site. Even for the ones that don’t it will give you at least one moderate to high quality link in a relatively short time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RSS Feed
    - If you have a blog or press releases, then a blog is a great way to get links. Make sure you burn it at Feedburner.com. For linking build it’s simple sites will scrape your content (stealing). When they do make sure you get a back link by including links in the content back to your site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social media
    - Both Reddit and LinkedIn give back links. With Reddit they will give a backlink to any link that has 5 upvotes, and LinkedIn will do the same based off an unknown number of leaks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buy Existing/Abandoned/Expiring Domains
    - Older domains still have authority and can be a quick way to create a few link assets in a short time. by going to archive.org and repopulating it with some of the old content that got the most links. Also buying an existing website is more expensive, but it also has the most current value.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organizations
    - There are a number of organizations that will give quality back links, and while most of them will cost you some money. So the examples are your local Chamber of Commerce and Local Civics Leagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-1st-or-2nd-most-important-ranking-factor&quot;&gt;Content (1st or 2nd most important ranking factor)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often you will here Content is King for SEO, and that is true to a point. The key to good content is that it &lt;strong&gt;answers the users question&lt;/strong&gt;, and can be done through telling a story or by presenting a report. Make sure you use your keywords and &lt;strong&gt;Local SEO will want to have the location used as often and naturally as possible&lt;/strong&gt; The thing to remember is that there are 2 key parts to content for SEO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;quality&quot;&gt;Quality&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;major question&lt;/strong&gt; you should ask your self when you are writing content is there real value, something that is useful, that is unique, and of substance to visitors. The other things that you should consider are: make sure it is optimized  and is your content linkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways you can &lt;strong&gt;build link-worthiness&lt;/strong&gt; into content planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;original research/data;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;expert opinions/quotes;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;collaboration; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;unique imagery/video.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;optimizing your content&lt;/strong&gt; there are some basic rules that you should obey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include your keywords where they feel natural never stuff keywords because there is no optimal key word destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep your post above 250 words and ideally at least 350 because if you don’t have that much then you probably don’t have a page. Consider combining pages because content under 250 can cause significant issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also make sure that you use the word associated with your keywords. If you have a page on “A complete history of Maryland” then Google would expect you to write about Annapolis and Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;freshness&quot;&gt;Freshness&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh content is often preferred by google and and can be done by publishing new content or up dating old content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freshness score will initially be based off of its &lt;strong&gt;inception date, which decays or time&lt;/strong&gt;. This means initially content might rank high, but over time it will decrease. An example of this breaking news or events that are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amount you &lt;strong&gt;up date your content&lt;/strong&gt; can also influence freshness. When you do update your make sure it is a major update because Google may choose to ignore small changes, and care the most about core content. Less important content includes:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Comments&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Advertisements&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Navigation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Boilerplate material&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Date/time tags&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best Practices&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create new content regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When updating, focus on core content, and not unimportant boilerplate material.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that small changes may be ignored. If you’re going to update a link, you may consider updating all the text around the link.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Steady link growth is almost always better than spiky, inconsistent link growth.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All other things being equal, links from fresher pages likely pass more value than links from stale pages.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Engagement metrics are your friend. Work to increase clicks and user satisfaction.
  If you change the topic of a page too much, older links to the page may lose value.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating older content can work amazingly well when you earn fresh links to the content, and updates authoritative content. And the goal shouldn’t be to update your site for the sake of updating isn’t going give the results. A good rule of thumb is that you should only update content if you do it in a timely manner that benefits users, with an aim to increase user engagement and help get fresh links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Technical SEO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Technical SEO isn’t a main ranking fact it will help with metrics such as bounce back and load time. The best time to implement these is before the launch of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;page-speed&quot;&gt;Page Speed&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While page speed isn’t a ranking factor, it has a large effect on usability. The best example is the often talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gigaspaces.com/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/&quot;&gt;Amazon Study where they found out that for every 100ms they lost 1%&lt;/a&gt;, put into simple term no user will wait 3 seconds or more and user won’t much longer for mobile sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Images add the most to file size and will often be the most important thing that you will have to change to optimize speed. The &lt;strong&gt;easiest way&lt;/strong&gt; to do this is by trying to reduce the file size as much as possible without reducing quality. The &lt;strong&gt;best way&lt;/strong&gt; to optimizing images is to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;srcset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content Delivery Network (CDN) is another way to speed up your sites load time. The way CDN works is to minimize the distance between the visitors and your website’s server, a CDN store a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity. &lt;strong&gt;Word of Warning&lt;/strong&gt; CDN take more effort and attention if you use a Content Management Systems because of Caching&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;on-page-factors&quot;&gt;On-Page Factors&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search “on-page SEO” into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=on+page+seo&amp;amp;oq=on+&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l5.1214j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=on+page+seo&amp;amp;start=0&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, Moz will tell you—through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/7-ways-to-improve-your-chances-for-featured-snippets/166128/&quot;&gt;featured snippet—it&lt;/a&gt; is “the practice of optimizing individual web pages to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines. On-page refers to both the content and HTML source code of a page that can be optimized, as opposed to off-page SEO which refers to links and other external signals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title Tags&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Title Tags are the most seen on page element because it will show up in the SERP as the blue link, in the tab of the web browser, and is a place for keyword placement. The most common layout is **page title&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;brand** with a  character limit of 70 characters before showing ellipses.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta Descriptions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are one of the most important on page factor, but not for SEO. The reason why it is so important is because goo copy can help reduce you bounce back rate because they know what to expect when they click through. For desktop, users will see up to 200 characters, while on mobile they’ll be shown up to 172 characters. To appeal to users on both devices, keep your description between 165 and 175 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/google-search-meta-tittle-tag.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image with meta and tittle tag highlighted&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading Tags&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your landing page or blog should include multiple heading tags, from the h1 down to a potential h6. The most important is the h1. You should never have more than one h1 tag on any page. Include multiple h2’s or h3’s as users scroll down the page. These are used as subheadings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the headings to represent the different sections of the page. You’ll notice the impact from both an SEO standpoint and a usability standpoint&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;schema&quot;&gt;Schema&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schema  Defined by Schema.org:  Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.
Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Schema.org is sponsored by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is Schema allows the 4 major search engines to better understand what content you have on your web site and in some case will show items (ranting and snippets) in the SERP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Local Search&lt;/strong&gt; you will need Schema to add NAP, hours, and rating so that they can show up in the SERP. Keep in mind the order of NAP doesn’t matter as long as it is the same throughout the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;mobile-friendliness&quot;&gt;Mobile Friendliness&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html&quot;&gt;Google is moving to Mobile First Indexing&lt;/a&gt; this means that your website should follow a mobile first approach. &lt;strong&gt;The key items&lt;/strong&gt; that you should be focusing on:
- Make sure that the website is fat finger Friendly
  - This means that you should be able to clearly use navigation elements and avoid missing clicks.
- Make sure your content (images, videos, and tables)
  - There are a number of ways to do this for each item. For images make sure that you use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;srcset&lt;/code&gt; and for video sure that the screen and navigation both resize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitepoint.com/30-amazing-jquery-tables/&quot;&gt;jQuery libraries&lt;/a&gt; that will take care of it for you&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data-hint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; in CSS and HTML method&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEO is a major pillar of your digital foot print&lt;/strong&gt; and take time to produce strong results, but will have a longer lasting effect unlike PPC campaigns when they’re done the benefits go with them. That’s why at &lt;a href=&quot;www.digitalroots.io&quot;&gt;Digital Roots&lt;/a&gt; make sure we are using the best tactics at the beginning of our development so our customers don’t lose any ground.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Check List for Yard Signs</title>
        <description>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many yard signs will be necessary to blanket your district?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will you use large wooden signs, small signs, a combination of both?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you do choose to use smaller signs look at using cardboard they are a little more expensive but are the easiest to put together.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will you put up signs in the primary (whether or not you have a primary opponent)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When will you put up your signs during the primary and general election?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a trickier question than one might at first think.  4x4 wooden signs driven into the ground by metal stakes should probably go up as early as possible in the campaign which is about 45 days out. However, the smaller paper signs are not durable enough usually to last 45 days of weather and in addition, they get stolen by kids and opponents more frequently depending on where you live.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What information is absolutely necessary to put on your yard sign?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too often, candidates try to put too much information on their yard signs. Generally, people only look at yard signs for a split second as they are driving and don’t have time to see much more than the name. Unfortunately, I have known many starting candidates who believed that the yard sign was the appropriate place to educate voters as to first name, middle initial, last name, nickname, office being sought. District number, party affiliation and who knows what else. The key is to have your last name as big as possible, use upper and lower case letters and keep other information to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are you going to develop your yard sign lists?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This can be done in several ways. First, contact all your friends and relatives that live in your district or near your district on main roads. Second, check with other candidates in the area for their yard sign lists. Third, distribute volunteer cards at all your events, and Republican events to gain yard sign locations. Fourth, do a mailing with a volunteer card, to all Republicans that voted in the ‘90 election, or the last school board election.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>List of htaccess Snippets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; files are for people that do not have rights to edit the main server configuration file. They are intrinsically slower and more complicated than using the main config. Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html&quot;&gt;how to in the httpd documentation&lt;/a&gt; for further details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: While dropping the snippet into an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; file is most of the time sufficient, there are cases when certain modifications might be required. Use at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: Apache 2.4 introduces a few breaking changes, most notably in access control configuration. For more information, check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html&quot;&gt;upgrading document&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/phanan/htaccess/issues/2&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are doing here is mostly collecting useful snippets from all over the interwebs (for example, a good chunk is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache&quot;&gt;Apache Server Configs&lt;/a&gt;) into one place. While we’ve been trying to credit where due, things might be missing. If you believe anything here is your work and credits should be given, let us know, or just send a PR.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rewrite-and-redirection&quot;&gt;Rewrite and Redirection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: It is assumed that you have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mod_rewrite&lt;/code&gt; installed and enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-www&quot;&gt;Force www&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example\.com [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [L,R=301,NC]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-www-in-a-generic-way&quot;&gt;Force www in a Generic Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTPS}s ^on(s)|
RewriteRule ^ http%1://www.%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; domain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4916222/htaccess-how-to-force-www-in-a-generic-way&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-non-www&quot;&gt;Force non-www&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/domain-www-or-no-www/&quot;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/apex-domains&quot;&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://yes-www.org/&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://no-www.org/&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; whether www or non-www is the way to go, so if you happen to be a fan of bare domains, here you go:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.example\.com [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [L,R=301]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-non-www-in-a-generic-way&quot;&gt;Force non-www in a Generic Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.
RewriteCond %{HTTPS}s ^on(s)|off
RewriteCond http%1://%{HTTP_HOST} ^(https?://)(www\.)?(.+)$
RewriteRule ^ %1%3%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-https&quot;&gt;Force HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}

# Note: It’s also recommended to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
# on your HTTPS website to help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
# See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security
&amp;lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&amp;gt;
    Header always set Strict-Transport-Security &quot;max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains&quot;
&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-https-behind-a-proxy&quot;&gt;Force HTTPS Behind a Proxy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful if you have a proxy in front of your server performing TLS termination.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-trailing-slash&quot;&gt;Force Trailing Slash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /+[^\.]+$
RewriteRule ^(.+[^/])$ %{REQUEST_URI}/ [R=301,L]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remove-trailing-slash&quot;&gt;Remove Trailing Slash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This snippet will redirect paths ending in slashes to their non-slash-terminated counterparts (except for actual directories), e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com/blog/&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;. This is important for SEO, since it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://overit.com/blog/canonical-urls&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; to have a canonical URL for every page.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
RewriteRule ^ %1 [R=301,L]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21417263/htaccess-add-remove-trailing-slash-from-url#27264788&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;redirect-a-single-page&quot;&gt;Redirect a Single Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;Redirect 301 /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html
Redirect 301 /oldpage2.html http://www.example.com/folder/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com/snippets/htaccess/301-redirects/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;redirect-using-redirectmatch&quot;&gt;Redirect Using RedirectMatch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RedirectMatch 301 /subdirectory(.*) http://www.newsite.com/newfolder/$1
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*).htm$ /$1.html
RedirectMatch 301 ^/200([0-9])/([^01])(.*)$ /$2$3
RedirectMatch 301 ^/category/(.*)$ /$1
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*)/htaccesselite-ultimate-htaccess-article.html(.*) /htaccess/htaccess.html
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*).html/1/(.*) /$1.html$2
RedirectMatch 301 ^/manual/(.*)$ http://www.php.net/manual/$1
RedirectMatch 301 ^/dreamweaver/(.*)$ /tools/$1
RedirectMatch 301 ^/z/(.*)$ http://static.askapache.com/$1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/301-redirect-with-mod_rewrite-or-redirectmatch.html#301_Redirects_RedirectMatch&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alias-a-single-directory&quot;&gt;Alias a Single Directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^source-directory/(.*) /target-directory/$1 [R=301,L]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alias-paths-to-script&quot;&gt;Alias Paths To Script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;FallbackResource /index.fcgi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example has an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.fcgi&lt;/code&gt; file in some directory, and any requests within that directory that fail to resolve a filename/directory will be sent to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.fcgi&lt;/code&gt; script. It’s good if you want &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baz.foo/some/cool/path&lt;/code&gt; to be handled by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baz.foo/index.fcgi&lt;/code&gt; (which also supports requests to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baz.foo&lt;/code&gt;) while maintaining &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baz.foo/css/style.css&lt;/code&gt; and the like. Get access to the original path from the PATH_INFO environment variable, as exposed to your scripting environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^$ index.fcgi/ [QSA,L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a less efficient version of the FallbackResource directive (because using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mod_rewrite&lt;/code&gt; is more complex than just handling the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FallbackResource&lt;/code&gt; directive), but it’s also more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;redirect-an-entire-site&quot;&gt;Redirect an Entire Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;Redirect 301 / http://newsite.com/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way does it with links intact. That is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www.oldsite.com/some/crazy/link.html&lt;/code&gt; will become &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www.newsite.com/some/crazy/link.html&lt;/code&gt;. This is extremely helpful when you are just “moving” a site to a new domain. &lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com/snippets/htaccess/301-redirects/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alias-clean-urls&quot;&gt;Alias “Clean” URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This snippet lets you use “clean” URLs – those without a PHP extension, e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/users&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/users.php&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abeautifulsite.net/access-pages-without-the-php-extension-using-htaccess/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Deny from all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apache-24&quot;&gt;Apache 2.4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# Require all denied
```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, this will lock you out from your content as well! Thus introducing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deny-all-access-except-yours&quot;&gt;Deny All Access Except Yours&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;## Apache 2.2
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Allow from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

## Apache 2.4
# Require all denied
# Require ip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&lt;/code&gt; is your IP. If you replace the last three digits with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0/12&lt;/code&gt; for example, this will specify a range of IPs within the same network, thus saving you the trouble to list all allowed IPs separately. &lt;a href=&quot;http://speckyboy.com/2013/01/08/useful-htaccess-snippets-and-hacks/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course there’s a reversed version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allow-all-access-except-spammers&quot;&gt;Allow All Access Except Spammers’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;## Apache 2.2
Order deny,allow
Deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxy

## Apache 2.4
# Require all granted
# Require not ip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
# Require not ip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deny-access-to-hidden-files-and-directories&quot;&gt;Deny Access to Hidden Files and Directories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hidden files and directories (those whose names start with a dot &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) should most, if not all, of the time be secured. For example: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.htpasswd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.hg&lt;/code&gt;…
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} -d [OR]
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule &quot;(^|/)\.&quot; - [F]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can just raise a “Not Found” error, giving the attacker no clue:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
RedirectMatch 404 /\..*$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deny-access-to-backup-and-source-files&quot;&gt;Deny Access to Backup and Source Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These files may be left by some text/HTML editors (like Vi/Vim) and pose a great security danger if exposed to public.
``` apacheconf
&amp;lt;FilesMatch “(.(bak|config|dist|fla|inc|ini|log|psd|sh|sql|swp)|~)$”&amp;gt;
    ## Apache 2.2
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Satisfy All&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Apache 2.4
# Require all denied
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/FilesMatch&amp;gt;
```

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disable-directory-browsing&quot;&gt;Disable Directory Browsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;Options All -Indexes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disable-image-hotlinking&quot;&gt;Disable Image Hotlinking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteEngine on
# Remove the following line if you want to block blank referrer too
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https?://(.+\.)?example.com [NC]
RewriteRule \.(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp)$ - [NC,F,L]

# If you want to display a “blocked” banner in place of the hotlinked image,
# replace the above rule with:
# RewriteRule \.(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp) http://example.com/blocked.png [R,L]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disable-image-hotlinking-for-specific-domains&quot;&gt;Disable Image Hotlinking for Specific Domains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want to disable image hotlinking from some bad guys only.
``` apacheconf
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^https?://(.+.)?badsite.com [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^https?://(.+.)?badsite2.com [NC,OR]
RewriteRule .(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp)$ - [NC,F,L]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;if-you-want-to-display-a-blocked-banner-in-place-of-the-hotlinked-image&quot;&gt;If you want to display a “blocked” banner in place of the hotlinked image,&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# replace the above rule with:
# RewriteRule .(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp) http://example.com/blocked.png [R,L]
```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;password-protect-a-directory&quot;&gt;Password Protect a Directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you need to create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.htpasswd&lt;/code&gt; file somewhere in the system:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bash
htpasswd -c /home/fellowship/.htpasswd boromir
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can use it for authentication:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
AuthType Basic
AuthName &quot;One does not simply&quot;
AuthUserFile /home/fellowship/.htpasswd
Require valid-user
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;password-protect-a-file-or-several-files&quot;&gt;Password Protect a File or Several Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;AuthName &quot;One still does not simply&quot;
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /home/fellowship/.htpasswd

&amp;lt;Files &quot;one-ring.o&quot;&amp;gt;
Require valid-user
&amp;lt;/Files&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;FilesMatch ^((one|two|three)-rings?\.o)$&amp;gt;
Require valid-user
&amp;lt;/FilesMatch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;block-visitors-by-referrer&quot;&gt;Block Visitors by Referrer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This denies access for all users who are coming from (referred by) a specific domain.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.htaccess-guide.com/deny-visitors-by-referrer/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
RewriteEngine on
# Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} somedomain\.com [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} anotherdomain\.com
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prevent-framing-the-site&quot;&gt;Prevent Framing the Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prevents the website to be framed (i.e. put into an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt; tag), when still allows framing for a specific URI.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
SetEnvIf Request_URI &quot;/starry-night&quot; allow_framing=true
Header set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN env=!allow_framing
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

``` apacheconf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ifmodule mod_deflate.c=&quot;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/ifmodule&gt;

    # Compress all output labeled with one of the following MIME-types

### Set Expires Headers
_Expires headers_ tell the browser whether they should request a specific file from the server or just grab it from the cache. It is advisable to set static content&#39;s expires headers to something far in the future.

If you don’t control versioning with filename-based cache busting, consider lowering the cache time for resources like CSS and JS to something like 1 week. [Source](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache)
``` apacheconf
&amp;lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&amp;gt;
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresDefault                                      &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;

  # CSS
    ExpiresByType text/css                              &quot;access plus 1 year&quot;

  # Data interchange
    ExpiresByType application/json                      &quot;access plus 0 seconds&quot;
    ExpiresByType application/xml                       &quot;access plus 0 seconds&quot;
    ExpiresByType text/xml                              &quot;access plus 0 seconds&quot;

  # Favicon (cannot be renamed!)
    ExpiresByType image/x-icon                          &quot;access plus 1 week&quot;

  # HTML components (HTCs)
    ExpiresByType text/x-component                      &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;

  # HTML
    ExpiresByType text/html                             &quot;access plus 0 seconds&quot;

  # JavaScript
    ExpiresByType application/javascript                &quot;access plus 1 year&quot;

  # Manifest files
    ExpiresByType application/x-web-app-manifest+json   &quot;access plus 0 seconds&quot;
    ExpiresByType text/cache-manifest                   &quot;access plus 0 seconds&quot;

  # Media

    ExpiresByType image/gif                             &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg                            &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;
    ExpiresByType image/png                             &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;
    ExpiresByType video/mp4                             &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;

    ExpiresByType video/webm                            &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;

  # Web feeds
    ExpiresByType application/atom+xml                  &quot;access plus 1 hour&quot;
    ExpiresByType application/rss+xml                   &quot;access plus 1 hour&quot;

  # Web fonts
    ExpiresByType application/font-woff2                &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;
    ExpiresByType application/font-woff                 &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;
    ExpiresByType application/vnd.ms-fontobject         &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;

    ExpiresByType image/svg+xml                         &quot;access plus 1 month&quot;
&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turn-etags-off&quot;&gt;Turn eTags Off&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By removing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ETag&lt;/code&gt; header, you disable caches and browsers from being able to validate files, so they are forced to rely on your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cache-Control&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Expires&lt;/code&gt; header. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/apache-speed-etags.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
``` apacheconf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ifmodule mod_headers.c=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    Header unset ETag
&lt;/ifmodule&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FileETag None
```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-php-variables&quot;&gt;Set PHP Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;php_value &amp;lt;key&amp;gt; &amp;lt;val&amp;gt;

# For example:
php_value upload_max_filesize 50M
php_value max_execution_time 240
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;custom-error-pages&quot;&gt;Custom Error Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;ErrorDocument 500 &quot;Houston, we have a problem.&quot;
ErrorDocument 401 http://error.example.com/mordor.html
ErrorDocument 404 /errors/halflife3.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-downloading&quot;&gt;Force Downloading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want to force the browser to download some content instead of displaying it.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
&amp;lt;Files *.md&amp;gt;
    ForceType application/octet-stream
    Header set Content-Disposition attachment
&amp;lt;/Files&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is a yang to this yin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prevent-downloading&quot;&gt;Prevent Downloading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want to force the browser to display some content instead of downloading it.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apacheconf
&amp;lt;FilesMatch &quot;\.(tex|log|aux)$&quot;&amp;gt;
    Header set Content-Type text/plain
&amp;lt;/FilesMatch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allow-cross-domain-fonts&quot;&gt;Allow Cross-Domain Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDN-served webfonts might not work in Firefox or IE due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/a&gt;. This snippet solves the problem.
``` apacheconf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ifmodule mod_headers.c=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &amp;lt;FilesMatch &quot;\.(eot|otf|ttc|ttf|woff|woff2)$&quot;&amp;gt;
        Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin &quot;*&quot;
    
&lt;/ifmodule&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Source](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/issues/32)

### Auto UTF-8 Encode
Your text content should always be UTF-8 encoded, no?
``` apacheconf
# Use UTF-8 encoding for anything served text/plain or text/html
AddDefaultCharset utf-8

# Force UTF-8 for a number of file formats
AddCharset utf-8 .atom .css .js .json .rss .vtt .xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;switch-to-another-php-version&quot;&gt;Switch to Another PHP Version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a shared host, chances are there are more than one version of PHP installed, and sometimes you want a specific version for your website. The following snippet should switch the PHP version for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;AddHandler application/x-httpd-php56 .php

# Alternatively, you can use AddType
AddType application/x-httpd-php56 .php
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disable-internet-explorer-compatibility-view&quot;&gt;Disable Internet Explorer Compatibility View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compatibility View in IE may affect how some websites are displayed. The following snippet should force IE to use the Edge Rendering Engine and disable the Compatibility View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&amp;gt;
    BrowserMatch MSIE is-msie
    Header set X-UA-Compatible IE=edge env=is-msie
&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serve-webp-images&quot;&gt;Serve WebP Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/?csw=1&quot;&gt;WebP images&lt;/a&gt; are supported and an image with a .webp extension and the same name is found at the same place as the jpg/png image that is going to be served, then the WebP image is served instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apacheconf&quot;&gt;RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} image/webp
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$1.webp -f
RewriteRule (.+)\.(jpe?g|png)$ $1.webp [T=image/webp,E=accept:1]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Writing your Campaign Plan and Determining the Strategy</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-the-campaign-plan&quot;&gt;WRITING THE CAMPAIGN PLAN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most difficult challenges for first time campaign manager was writing the campaign plan and trying to envision the big picture for what has to happen in a campaign. A campaign plan is critical because it helps you to formulate a strategy, decide where you will need, key people, create a timeline and, perhaps, most importantly, create a budget so you don’t spend your money too soon. One other benefit is that you are more likely to gain a contribution from a large giver if you sit down with them and give them a campaign plan that is well thought out. As an underdog, my campaign plan helped me raise about $6,000 from large givers and political action committees by showing them that I was a legitimate candidate.
One thing -that may help you in creating a campaign plan is to look at it as a series of questions. To help toward this end, I have written some questions and comments on the following pages. Even if you have already written a campaign plan, read through the questions and see if you are adequately prepared to tackle your upcoming campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;district-background&quot;&gt;DISTRICT BACKGROUND&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the voter registration numbers for your district?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many Democrats, Republicans and independents vote in a Presidential election?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the past voting history of your district?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t be able to get a voting history for legislative races very accurately since redistricting most probably means that your current district probably was part of two or more previous districts. However, you should know how high profile races (Presidential, U.S. Senator, Governor) and low profile races (State Treasurer, State Auditor) have done in your district&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the age demographics in your district?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how many people are registered to vote in certain age categories will help you a great deal with strategy and issues. How many registered voters are 18-24 (environment, tuition), 25-44 (education, family issues, crime, tax increases) 45-55 (Property taxes. College tuition, retirement issues, welfare abuse), 60 + (Property taxes, property taxes property taxes and traditional values).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the social demographics of the respective precincts in your district?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try and classify each precinct as a certain type of person. This can be a difficult thing to do with some precincts’, but is relatively easy with most. This, too, is very important for issue and strategy development. Think among some of these categories: rural/agricultural (property taxes, farm Issues), blue collar/working families (crime, property taxes, welfare abuse, little more pro-life, job creation), country club/business (income taxes, property taxes, economic development, little more pro-choice, education) middle class/ young families (education, crime, some environment and taxes), small town (health of small towns and its institutions, education, school consolidation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opponent-background&quot;&gt;OPPONENT BACKGROUND&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the background of your opponent (education, jobs, place of birth, places lived) ?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If incumbent, what are the committees served on?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If incumbent, what are the key votes cast?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local group, how do they feel about the votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the stands of your opponent on key issues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is different than key votes since we don’t have clear votes on most of the key issues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If incumbent, how high is the absentee rate for voting?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If incumbent, do they have a home in the District, or a home outside of it?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-background&quot;&gt;YOUR BACKGROUND&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are your political and personal strengths in light of the district and the upcoming election race?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very good idea to list these and to know them so you can emphasize them throughout your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are your political and personal weaknesses in light of the district and the upcoming election race?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is sometimes an uncomfortable thing to do, but it is important to be honest with yourself and your close advisors. I guarantee that people will probably find out your weakness anyway from your opponent. If you deal with it early, you can prepare for any attacks, or if necessary, cast a favorable light on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is your background (include political campaigns, education, jobs, awards won, other recognition, memberships, etc)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;name-identification&quot;&gt;NAME IDENTIFICATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is your plan to raise name identification?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What mediums will you use to establish your name identification?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some mediums may be social media, paid digital, billboards, newspaper ads, radio ads, literature, etc*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;earned-media&quot;&gt;EARNED MEDIA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### (PRESS RELEASES, ETC.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the addresses, phone numbers, email and news contacts at your local newspaper, radio stations and television stations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will you use each social media platform for&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is a proper press release written?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The state party should be able to send you information on how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the deadlines for your newspapers radio stations and television stations?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When is a press release adequate and when is a press conference necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doorknocking&quot;&gt;DOORKNOCKING&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many households are there in your district?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally figure this by taking the number of registered voters (15,000) and
multiply it by .67 to get the number of actual doors that will have to be knocked to hit the home of each registered voter. Example: 15,000 x .67 = 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many doors can you knock in an hour?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This varies widely. Depending on what yon say to people, whether you survey them, etc. will impact how many doors you can hit in an hour. In addition, the time of day also has a major impact because if people aren’t hone, you can hit a great many more homes. This isn’t necessarily effective, but it will increase the number of homes you hit. You can generally figure around 15 to 25 homes per hour. If you hit less than 15, then you may be spending too much time with each household, if you are hitting more than 30 or 40, then you may not be knocking when enough people are home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many hours a week can you realistically spend knocking on doors?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many weeks is it going to take to knock on all the doors in your district?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure this by dividing the number of households in your district by the product of the number of doors knocked in an hour multiplied by the number of hours you can knock in a week. Example: 10,000 households divided by (20 homes/hr. x 12 hrs/week) - 42 weeks to knock every registered household in the district. Now, if you don’t have 42 weeks, then you will have to increase the number of homes per hour, the number of hours per week or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are you going to do with each household that you knock so that they will remember you after you leave?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doorknocking is the most important aspect of campaigning, but it helps most if they remember what your name is after you’ve left. Frequently people don’t. Literature is fine to leave at each household, but it is generally thrown away within 24 hours of your visit. One very effective way to extend your name identification is to follow up your visit with a email/postcard thanking them for the visit. This requires keeping close track of the names you actually visit and constantly updating your voter walking list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you intend to use a registered voter-walking list -and-knock on only those homes with registered voters or forego a list and hit every home registering those people who are not currently registered?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the voter answers the door, do you plan to simply give your literature with a quick spiel about yourself or your issues, or do you plan to administer a survey when they answer the door?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What order are you going to door knock your district?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you should doorknock your precincts in a systematic, planned way meant to maximize voter impact. These decisions should be made through the use of voter information that can be provided to you. by the State Party or you can simply rank your precincts yourself through a prioritization system. If you would like to see the system that I used, please feel free to call me or write me. Generally, I believe that you should knock your most important precincts between September 15th and October 31st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;important-dates&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT DATES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need to petition on. When are petitions available to get signatures for your candidacy?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When are signature petitions due for your candidacy?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When do you need to file a formation of candidacy form with the Campaign finance disclosure commission?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When are the primary and general elections?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When can yard signs go up for the primary and general?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When do yard signs have to be down after the primary and general?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When is your precinct caucus, county convention, district convention and the Republican State convention?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When are the parades and fairs in or near your district?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;campaign-organization&quot;&gt;CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you plan to recruit volunteers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying starting an Internship program at your local college and high school, and try to reach out to both political an civil group to speak at a meeting
2.	What areas of the campaign do you need specific volunteers to fill?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should consider having people help with these positions: overall coordinator or manager, fundraising, Get-out-The-Vote, events coordinator, yard signs, mailing coordinator, absentee ballot coordinator, media (press release, conference) coordinator, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What type of people do you need at the top of your campaign as chairs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try to find people who appeal to different constituencies, in my campaign, I have a leader from the only small town in the district, a leading ag person and a well respected elected official known county wide. For my fundraising chairs, I have the best known doctor in -the county and a leading lawyer who represents any big business clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will you have one person organize each precinct?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;campaign-budget&quot;&gt;CAMPAIGN BUDGET&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a budget that used all basic elements of a campaign&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description– Number        Cost:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct Mail Campaign- 6  $44,100&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dues/Sponsorships -      $2,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOTAL&lt;/strong&gt; :         &lt;strong&gt;$83,810&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-out-the-vote-program-gotv&quot;&gt;GET OUT THE VOTE PROGRAM (GOTV)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who do intend to turn out on election day to vote for  you.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my opinion that too many legislative campaigns turn out voters that are already intending to vote.  Let me explain.  We know that certain voters vote in every election.  Come rain or shine, they never miss.  So why   use your phone bank or postcard to remind these people to vote?  Clearly, these regular voters need a contact before the election explaining why they should support you and not a GOTV contact.  Take this for what it’s worth, but I would only concentrate on turning out those Republican voters, or identified supporters among independents, that have a history of missing elections. All states keeps records of who votes in what elections so it is easy to determine which voters are regular voters and which need a little reminder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What methods do you intend to use to turnout your target groups?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider using a first-class postcard, mailed on Saturday so that it arrives Monday. Also see that you have turnout phoning organized for Monday night before the election and that the local party has phone banks for election day. Another idea that we have used in Galveston is to rise early on election day and place a large “VOTE TODAY” sign on every 4x4 yard sign before people leave for work. Other mediums such as digital, radio, newspaper or T.V. work fine for part of your GOTV program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology&quot;&gt;TECHNOLOGY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will need to set up a Website and will have to deiced between a static or CMS&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you intent to use excel or a more advance system, and is the system going to be all in one or pieced together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working with less then 75,000-voter universe you can get away with using excel and programs like MailChimp. If you are trying to manage a bigger universe then you will need a more advance system like i360, rVote, and NationBuilder. While they all do similar things i360 and rVote are more targeted to just doing canvassing and voter modeling because it doesn’t have any digital tools, while Nationbuilder is more about managing a digital presence, due to being able to host a website and digital media tools, and can be expanded to do canvassing but no modeling. I prefer to use one that can do more voter out-reach and modeling because of the ease of finding consultants to do a better job at the other tasks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;media-mix&quot;&gt;MEDIA MIX&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should you spend your money on digital, radio, T.V., direct mail, door-to-door, newspaper ads, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that candidates should use a mix of audio and visual mediums to establish name identification and to penetrate with a message. This is because some people have better memory recall from audio than visual and vice-versa. Visual would include: digital, direct mail, literature, newspaper ads, yard signs, billboards and television. Audio would include radio, television, speeches, phone banking and door-to-door.
I personally believe (and this view isn’t shared by everyone) that too many Legislative candidates concentrate on visual education and ignore audio education. Behavioral learning abilities dictate that they both be used if you actually want to penetrate to the voter.
The combination that you use depends on the mediums in your district, while digital will work in both rural and urban districts. Radio, newspaper and direct mail will probably be the best choices in a rural district. In an urban district cable television, local television news commercials, and local newspapers can also be added to the list to be bought for radio or television to penetrate,.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When will you run your ads, mail your literature and start you digital ad buys?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly you will want to be out with your name on yard signs and parades, etc., as early and as often as you can, however, when should you spend your money on paid mediums? Well consider some polling research?  Non party line voters can’t begin making up their minds who they are going to vote for until about ten to fourteen days out from the election. Breaking this out in age groups, many senior citizens make their mind up seven to ten days out while 18-24 year olds decide the day before the election or at the polls. All other are somewhere in between.
Therefore, if you are mailing your “lower the property tax” message to seniors, start about two weeks out, while you may want to save your pro-environment mailings to 18-24 year olds until three to five days out.
No matter what else, you will want to spend the great preponderance of your money when people are making up their minds, and that is close to the election. Think of it as holding your fire until you see the whites of their eyes. If you fire too early you’re wasting your ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you, intend to design your media and your literature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes a special talent to create great literature, or commercials, but let me make a couple of suggestions that might help you. First, collect examples from other successful candidates and try to emulate those.  Second, Don’t overburden your reader with too much information in literature or commercials.  Keep it simple and repeat your main point over and over.  Third, make sure you have your name in the literature or commercial repeatedly.  Fourth, use visuals and pictures liberally.  Fifth, don’t be afraid to be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you plan to target your message through your media?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that it requires six contacts with a voter to penetrate with a message. That’s why you hear the suggestion to use three or four issues and keep pounding away at them. With that in mind, there are some very easy ways to target your voter with your message. Using voter information from state voter registration files, you can target in three ways: party, precinct, age.  Clearly, you can tell a lot by whether a person is a Republican, Democrat or Independent.  I also know that the people in rural precincts are concerned about different things than those in my blue collar precincts. Other targeting information that night be helpful is demographic information available from radio stations about their target markets. The same information is available with television.
Example: What if I wanted to target a message to Republicans, in precinct DV12 over the age of 60 with a message about property taxes. Well, I would do three things. First I would pull the names off of my computer of everybody in my district that fits those three criteria. I would use this list for a mailing to these people. Second, I would buy time on the local radio station whose demographics most target that group of people.  Finally, I might put an ad on the digital (cost at most $5 CPM) that best targets this group like CNN or the financial news station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In writing your campaign plan, your strategy will depend heavily on the type of race you have If you are the only Republican in a heavily Republican open district, then your race is going to be significantly different than most challengers. Please keep in mind that 95% of incumbents get re-elected. Therefore, if you are a challenger that intends to be a part of the 5%, you must 1) be aggressive, 2) door knock every door (at least once), 3) start early, 4) raise a lot of money, 5) use “voting” issues to take voters away from your opponent, and 6) take some risks. Too many challengers are afraid to take risks. Challengers are frequently so afraid of offending anyone that they run bland campaigns that don’t make a case for kicking the incumbent out of office.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Recruit a Grassroots Army</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Democrats routinely field more effective volunteer armies than Republicans, largely due to the help of their allies in organized labor. But Democrats have also had more success building grassroots organizations because they’re often better at communicating with and organizing their base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the 2010 midterms, when GOP voter enthusiasm was supposed to have been at a 15-year high, campaign staffers across the country were at a loss as to how to get enough unpaid boots on the ground. As the 2016 cycle ramps up, down-ballot candidates—particularly in the early states—face the added challenge of competing for volunteers with over a half a dozen presidential campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some campaign managers may simply throw up their hands and hire paid workers rather than recruit volunteers. But don’t put out the call for resumes before spending some real time trying to build a homegrown volunteer effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my observation, volunteers tend to fall into five distinct categories, which I’ve developed into five “clinical case studies.” Using these in your recruiting process should help identify the right volunteers for your campaign and help you manage and retain them once they’re on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-loyal-foot-soldier&quot;&gt;1 The loyal foot soldier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: The foot soldier is the Republican version of the Democratic union faithful. These are the tried-and-true volunteers that turn out every election cycle. Their stomping grounds are county GOP meetings, civic organizations (think Rotary, Kiwanis), VFW halls and trade associations. Common varieties include middle-aged local businessmen, grannies who could stuff envelopes with their eyes closed and wiry old veterans with their phone-dialing fingers at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: Good foot soldiers are worth their weight in gold. They’ve been there, done this, so they understand what volunteer duties consist of and won’t get bored or require constant attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: They’ve seen campaigns, and campaign hacks, come and go, and are usually not shy about expressing their opinion of your operation. To retain these volunteers, it’s important to present a competent and professional front. Also, as they trend older, they occasionally resist new technology, so they may need some coaxing to get comfortable with innovations like VoIP phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: Cherish your foot soldiers. Let them do their preferred task, and rest in the knowledge that they will do it well. Use them to train other volunteers in their age range, and reward them with campaign merchandise, they probably collect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-groupie&quot;&gt;2 The groupie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: These volunteers are all about your candidate. They either have some personal connection to him or her or, on a larger race, they might just be a big fan. The thrill of being around the candidate, and the idea that they are making a difference for him or her, is the driving force behind their involvement in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: Groupies will literally walk over hot coals for your candidate. You can’t instill that kind of devotion in anyone else, paid or volunteer. As long as these volunteers believe that what they are doing is the best way they can help the candidate, they will do just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: Because they are so invested in the candidate, often on a personal level, groupies tend to rank relatively high on the high maintenance scale. They can also be fiercely critical if they feel that the campaign is putting their candidate at risk, such as by releasing a negative TV advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: You know what they want, so give it to them. These are the ideal volunteers for visibility and crowd building at events, walking in parades and handing out literature at fairs. The caveat here is that these volunteers need to be well trained, or well supervised, so they understand what they are there to do and don’t spend the entire event trying to chat up the candidate. Still, once the event is over, make sure they get rewarded with a personal thank you, and get a photo-op sometime along the campaign trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-architect-in-his-own-mind&quot;&gt;3 The architect (in his own mind)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: This Karl Rove wannabe is the consummate political junkie that desperately wants to be on the staff. He’s typically convinced himself that if he were in charge, the campaign would be on a straight path to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: There aren’t many. They probably know all the insider terminology, and will employ industry terms like “micro targeting” unnecessarily in conversation. If they are local, they may have a body of knowledge on past races and major players that could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: Architects view themselves as strategists, not grunt workers, so they are generally long on advice and short on actual help. Because they put themselves before the campaign, it is difficult to get them to be team players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: Pair them up with a tolerant fellow volunteer and a GPS device and let them drive and pontificate while their partner knocks on doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-eager-beaver&quot;&gt;4 The eager beaver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: The eager beaver is the loyal foot soldier without the experience. Generally high school or college kids, these volunteers are enthusiastic and all about helping the cause in any way they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: Eager beavers are energetic, personable and open to instruction. They will likely be thrilled just to be a part of the campaign and are willing to do anything asked of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: With all teenagers, the tendency to be flaky goes with the territory. As a result, they will occasionally no-show when club meetings, sports practice and trouble borrowing the car get in the way. Eager beavers tend to glamorize the staff, so they can be pesky. But at the end of day it’s worth spending five minutes of your time chatting them up if it results in 500 phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: Although they require a bit more time and effort on your part, these volunteers will be among your best. Try to recruit them early by staking out local college campuses or posting on social networking sites, and then get them to recruit their friends. Eager beavers tend to be friendly and outgoing, so they’re great for direct voter contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-resume-builder&quot;&gt;5 The resume builder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis: The resume builder is often similar in age and outward appearance to the eager beaver, but is involved with the campaign for an entirely different reason. He or she is in it primarily to pad their resume. Generally college kids or recent graduates, resume builders are typically competent and tend to be comparatively reliable since they are looking to get a recommendation for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: The resume builders are easy to understand, because their motivation is clear. Agree with it or not, you know what they’re in it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks: Resume builders’ self-interested approach will be off-putting to true-believer types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescription: Make it clear what’s in it for them, and they will do what you need done. Resume builders are all about the bottom line. If they seem dissatisfied with the work they’re doing, offer them a title promotion to sweeten the deal. They will generally clean toilets as long as they get to put deputy something-or-other on their resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each volunteer is obviously a unique individual, but many of them can be categorized. The sooner you figure out what they’re looking to get out of the experience, the easier it will be to develop the tools to get what you need out of them. After all, if your campaign can’t motivate people who are already supporters, how can you expect to influence voters?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Secrets of Political Domain Names</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more candidates are registering domain names for their campaigns and web sites. Even more, cybersquatters are doing the same for “up and coming” political stars so they can resell it back to the candidate when they seek higher office. Reserving a domain name for the World Wide Web should be a simple issue and if you follow these rules, it will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t Wait to Reserve Your Domain Name!
Even if you’re not ready to build a web site yet or establish your presence on the Web, go ahead and reserve your domain name. It’s inexpensive and it could save you money later. Reserving a domain name will typically cost around $70, but some companies will charge as little as $60 and others will charge as much as $100. It can be worth it to pay a little more if some consulting comes with it. But if you know what you want, you should be able to get it for $70. Keep in mind that you are only purchasing a two-year license for the name, but you have the right to renew it after that period should you choose. Most Internet design companies will reserve the name for you and there are numerous places on the Web to reserve it yourself with a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose a name that is easy to remember and will stand the test of time.
Don’t make your domain name complicated. If you run into a voter on the street and they ask where they can sign up to help, an easy to remember domain name is critical. I generally recommend to candidates that their political domain name be the same as their given name. In other words, if your name is Rand Paul, then reserve the name &lt;a href=&quot;http://randpaul.com&quot;&gt;www.randpaul.com&lt;/a&gt; or www.randpaul.org for you web domain. The reasons are simple: first, if people can remember your name, they can find you on the web. Second, no matter what office you seek or what year you run, it can travel with you. Finally, if you succeed and get elected, you can also transform it into a constituent site for your office – something that can’t be said for a campaign related domain name (like www.electrandpaul.com). For those three reasons, I see no reason to complicate the matter further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the domain name you want is unavailable, keep it simple.
Sometimes www.randpaul.com is not available - especially if it’s a common name. As Mick Jagger would say, “Sometimes you don’t get what you want, you get what you need.” So, choose a domain name that is also simple and portable through different offices and years. Consider a name like www.randforusa.com or www.randonworks.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an effective domain name, let everyone know about it.
It’s not enough to have a good domain name, when you make it an integral part of your election effort, be sure to advertise it properly. Consider these mediums as you pursue your name identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some candidates now are putting their domain names on their yard signs: JohnSmith.com instead of the standard Vote for John Smith. I have mixed feelings about this, but you saw some of this with signs in the Presidential campaigns this year.
Register your domain name with all the big search engines. There are over 900 search engines these days, but only about 30 – 40 that really matter. Many companies have services that will register your web site for a low fee. It’s important to have this done at least once a month for four months.
Display your domain name prominently in your direct mail, literature, notepads, radio ads, print ads and television ads. It will raise your individual name identification while creating an effective tool for organizational politics.
The bottom line is simple: In politics today, you need a domain name. Don’t wait, Ted Cruz wishes he had moved earlier to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tedcruz.com&quot;&gt;www.tedcurz.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tools to follow social media</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Figuring out what is trending on Twitter can be difficult. Do you use the advance search to look for keywords? Do you look at a list of thought leader every day? Check to see what’s on your timeline?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of tools out there that can help you discover what is popular right now to help you reach out to your targeted audience. Below are three that are some of the best around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/buzzsumo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buzzsumo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buzzzsumo searches Twitter for the most popular keywords or domains and can show results by time period, from last 24 hours up to a year. The best thing about Buzzsumo is that it tracks keywords and domains across multiple social media site including Google + this will allow you to add your two cents to the conversation no matter where it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/topsy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Topsy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topsy is a social search engine that displays results similar to Google. One of the biggest advantages to Topsy is that it offers a more immediate time filter the Buzzsumo ranging from the past hour to 30 days. You can also filter by links, videos, tweets, and by relevancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest advantages of Topsy is that it goes further with Topsy Analytics. There you can look at the volume of tweets sent each day and compare them to up to 2 other keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/socialmention.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Socialmention&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socialmention unlike Buzzsumo and Topsy focuses on real-time search results this means that is doesn’t automatically sort by popularity or volume. The big advantage of Social mention is you can see the latest tweets, blog posts and other social posts about any topic you choose, from any time, or from a specific time like the past hour for the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the left side you can see some basic stats about your chosen keyword, such as the sentiment and reach. There is other useful information that you can use to dive deeper into what content is popular available too, like the top tweeters tweeting about your topic and the most popular related hashtags.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Price Per Click Guide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With voter moving to digital platform social media like Facebook and YouTube, campaigns need to make sure that they treat their digital campaign like it’s own campaign with the ability to fundraise, voter ID, voter registration, and GOTV. This will allow it to work to enhance your traditional campaign beyond a strictly digital strategy. The biggest thing is that digital campaign brings in more reliable voter’s date making measurements. This is a huge improvement because currently canvassing has to do some guesswork about whether the support is real or the voter was being polite, and trying to end the conversation. While you can train voters to mitigate this digital look beyond what they say and take into consideration how long they spend on a page, what pages they looked at, and are able to see what they are talking about throw tags. Also, it is much better at targeting voter because of the range of option from demographics to time and even IP addresses. When looking at digital platform, there are some basics that are shared with all of the options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-are-3-way-you-can-bid-with-digital-platforms&quot;&gt;There are 3 way you can bid with digital platforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/0505496001433988952-ppc intro-html-44bd1ed20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bad example of digital GOTV Get out the Vote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each platform allows for different bids, but you will always run into some combination of these 3, and for most people CPC and CPA are the best because it allows any individual to set up an ad that does well because they mitigate the need for staff to do ad copy and test. That being said the cheapest if you have the stuff already is CPM because you are able to get the cost per click much lower since you bid for 1000 impressions at a time at a low rate. Also, CPM is the best way to do voter outreach for a GOTV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A digital
  GOTV is one of the best ways to target the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voterparticipation.org/the-rising-american-electorate/&quot;&gt;Rising American Electorate&lt;/a&gt;, but there are few things that you should
  keep in mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoid-lots-of-text&quot;&gt;Avoid Lots of Text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/0505496001433988952-ppc%20intro-html-m166e5a40.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bad example of digital GOTV Get out the Vote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-picture&quot;&gt;Have A Picture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/0505496001433988952-ppc%20intro-html-mcd0f885.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;example with the best picture for digital GOTV Get out the Vote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-it-short&quot;&gt;Keep it short&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/0505496001433988952-ppc%20intro-html-m3474715b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fat fing design for digital GOTV Get out the Vote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Cost Per Impression work great for GOTV you are going to want to use Cost Per Click or Cost Per Action for digital fundraising. This will allow you to pay for only the view that clicks on the ad. This means that if you have done your targeting and ad copy correct, then the visitor will have a likely chance a donating given they were drawn in by the ad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jeb&#39;s Problem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton are often seen as the inevitable nominees for their parties, Hillary Clinton is the only one of the two was there is any certainty of becoming the nomination. The reason why Hillary Clinton can count on the nomination is because she is seen as the most likely candidate to defeat the Republican nominee this means that at least 39% of caucus-goers will likely vote for here. In contrast, while 38% of Republican caucus say defeating the democratic nominee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/poll.gif&quot; alt=&quot;poll of Jeb Bush&#39;s Problem&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breitbart&quot;&gt;Breitbart:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney—the 2012 nominee—failed to turn out the Republican base in the 2012 election with most estimates saying at least 5 million conservatives stayed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feeling that Mitt Romney lost for being too moderate is a deeply held thought in many of the grassroots activists that make up the Tea Party, Very Conservative, and Born Again Christians coalitions. This has left the Republican primary somewhat of a mystery because with no clear frontrunner against Hillary the next way to determine who is the most likely to win would be based off of fundraising, but this has also changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ny-times&quot;&gt;NY Times:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And candidates like Mr. Cruz, Bobby Jindal or Rand Paul need not cater to mainline donors and fund-raisers, whose allegiance has been a deciding factor with almost every Republican nomination of the last three decades. Instead, they can combine grass-roots fund-raising online with a few large checks from conservative billionaires, amassing enough to be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Super PACs more candidates will be able to keep going and unlike 2012 where only Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney had Super PAC this time it is a requirement for everyone. While Jeb Bush still hasn’t released his fundraising totals no one will be scared off by them because as everybody has pointed out there is no reason not to run.&lt;/p&gt;
