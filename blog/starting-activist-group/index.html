    <article class="post-content" itemprop="text">
      <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>One of the best places to start an activist group is online because it allows for you to start organizing with low fixed costs. The major hurdle most will face is what type of organization will you set up and how will you get started in this article we will look at different Political Organization and how to start growing your digital footprint.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-organize">How to Organize</h1>

<p>The first step is creating an organization so you can fundraise, and while there are many structures from 527 groups to 501cs if you are starting out you should choose some form of the Political Action Committee (PAC) for three major reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You create a level of transparency through <a href="http://fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) reports. This will allow you to create better trust with donors and activist because they can see into your organization’s finances, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-levin/are-those-online-politica_b_13162006.html">know whether or not you are a scam</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know how effective clicktivism is and one reason for my ignorance is that none of the clicktivist groups I regularly interact with do much reporting back to their members and supporters. For example, I’ve been on Move-On’s list since 1998 and I don’t recall ever seeing from them (or from any of the other groups) reports that answered questions …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-hartford/the-limits-of-clicktivism_b_13956416.html">The Huffington Post: The Limits of “Clicktivism”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Using a PAC is also better because the FEC often hosts webinars to help with reporting and compliance, in contrast the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) don’t have as much support with 527 and 501c4-6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final reason to use a PAC is because you can set up an Independent Expenditure Committee (Super PAC) if you are interested in raising large sum of money, and what to control the effort from IDing and Fundraising to Persuasion and GOTV, or you can setup a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;biw=1182&amp;bih=731&amp;q=fec+nonconnected+committee+guide&amp;oq=FEC+Non&amp;gs_l=serp.3.0.0.6416.8422.0.10681.7.5.2.0.0.0.77.357.5.5.0....0...1..64.serp..0.4.224...0i10k1.HX7XiXJrm4k">None Connect Committee</a>, which has a donation limit of  $5,000 per year. The biggest advantage with a None Connect is that you can donate to federal candidates, and coordinate with them this allows you to be more focused on fundraising and one or two other activities.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>This is a brief look at PACs Please visit <a href="http://fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> website to learn more about PACs, and your state election board about you state based options</strong></p>

<p>If you are interested in starting a 501c there are some limitations that lead most organizations going this route to set up a 501c3 and a 501c4 so that they can raise money that is tax deductible, and GOTV with the 501c3 and ID and Persuade with the 501c4. They will often be listed as affiliation and some example of these are Human Rights Campaign Foundation (501c3) / Human Rights Campaign (501c4), and Americans for Prosperity Foundation (501c3) and Americans For Prosperity (501c4).</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-campaign">Starting the Campaign</h2>

<p>To start any campaign you have to choose a scoop, and while most people what to start and organize nationwide the problem comes down to scale because while a national organization saying they have 750,000 members might seem impressive, but they have no real influence because their support will be spread across 50 states, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_television_stations_in_North_America_by_media_market">210 designated market areas</a>, 435 congressional districts, which have <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;q=average+number+of+voter+per+congressional+districts&amp;oq=average+number+of+voter+per+congressional+districts&amp;gs_l=serp.3...24138.29411.0.29511.28.28.0.0.0.0.105.2044.23j3.26.0....0...1.1.64.serp..3.9.662...0i7i30k1j0i8i7i30k1j0i8i30k1.kjDV6DeEVkk">approximately 700,000 voters </a> each, and <a href="https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9799/2971">3,141 counties and county equivalents</a>.</p>

<p>The other thing that you will have to keep in mind is cost because the more you spend on basics (IE. website, lists, and services) the more you will have to raise before you can spend on advocacy. So it is best to start locally and grow from there, but no matter what the scale of the organization is you will first need is a Website to be your digital outreach base.</p>

<h3 id="getting-up-and-running">Getting Up and Running</h3>

<p>The first thing that you will need is a website to pass your digital outreach from. The website doesn’t have to be complicated it can be a simple static website hosted for free by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, but should include email sign up, donate, and a blog for your content. It will also help if you familiarize yourself with a Spread Sheet program because this will be how you will organize your data (. IE volunteers, social media IDs, donor records).</p>

<h6 id="thing-to-keep-in-mind">Thing to Keep in Mind</h6>

<p>While it may seem easier to use an all-in one system like NationBuilder the problem is that most of the tools are ad-ones, and the ones that aren’t have free equivalents like <a href="https://www.meshfire.com/">MeshFire</a> for social media listening tool. The most important thing to keep in mind is that pivot tables are a strong tool that are included in spreadsheet programs and can handle the volume of data you will have at the beginning. So make sure that you know the full cost before you start with an all-in one service.</p>

<h3 id="step-one">Step One</h3>

<p>The very first thing you will need to do is obtain a domain name the best place to start is <a href="http://domains.google/">Google Domain</a> because places like GoDaddy will buy the domain name that you search for through their website forcing you to use them. Once you have the domain name make sure to claim it on every social media account from Facebook to GitHub any anything else you can think of. This step is to make sure that people don’t assume your organization identity on a platform you don’t use.</p>

<h3 id="website-basics">Website Basics</h3>

<p>The basic cost of a website depends on how much you are willing to do yourself. The cheapest option will be creating a static website for the landing page, and use a Static Site Generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to maintain a blog. While this way is by far the cheapest you will need to know how to build a simple website, and be able to integrate some third party services. Another option is to use a <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> site. The biggest benefit of this solution is that you don’t need to know anything about a website. This is because every web host has 1 click WordPress set-up, and there is plenty of theme market place like <a href="http://themeforest.net/">Themeforest</a> that have non-for profit and campaign web themes. The biggest problem is cost because while you can host a WordPress site for $5 per month it will crash the moment you go viral, and the only way to avoid the problem is to spend any where from $50 to $250 a month on hosting.</p>

<h4 id="free-website">Free Website</h4>

<h5 id="fundraising">Fundraising</h5>

<p>The two tools that are non-partisan that I have used are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://politics.raisethemoney.com/">Raise the Money</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://transaxt.com/default.aspx">Transaxt</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All fundraising platforms use a transaction fee, but they can vary Raise the Money is the most expensive at 4.9% + $.25 and Transaxt bearing 4.5% with partisan ones like ActBlue is 3.95% and Revv being 4% + $.30. These Platforms are set up for fundraising so they are your best bet over option like <a href="https://snipcart.com/">Snipcart</a>.</p>

<h5 id="email">Email</h5>

<p>There are a lot of email tools out there, but <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> has the best free tier and has pre-styled forms for your website. If you grow beyond the free tier there could be better priced option based on what kind of service you are looking for (IE. month to month or bulk), and changing to them isn’t difficult because they all have export and import options.</p>

<h5 id="blog">Blog</h5>

<p>Maintaining a blog for a static site use to be difficult, but over the last few years <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">Static Site Generators</a> have made maintain a blog relatively simple. The most popular is Jekyll, but it was built to be used with a Mac so if you are on Windows make sure you take a look at the alternatives because setting up Jekyll can be difficult. If you are looking to set up a Jekyll site you cab make make it act like a <a href="../static-site-cms/">CRM with a few simple steps</a>, and should be placed in a subfolder ie. <code class="highlighter-rouge">/blog</code>.</p>

<p>The other option is to use <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> as your blog platform, which has a few advantages. The biggest benefit is that because it is built around a social media platform, so it has tools to help disseminate your content to the right people right away. The other one is that people don’t need any technology skills because it uses a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor. If you do go this route try to buy <code class="highlighter-rouge">.blog</code> of your domain because you will be unable to set-up the blog in a subfolder or subdomain, and can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.blog</code> <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214110127-About-custom-domains">domain for your Medium</a> blog, and redirect visitor from your main page. The biggest downside is that you don’t have control over the blog layout or features so it is less customizable, and will be harder to raise money off or collect emails from an article .</p>

<h5 id="hosting">Hosting</h5>

<p>There are many options for hosting a static Website from <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which is free to <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2424725,00.asp">options</a> that can cost between $1.00 a month for a basic shared hosting to $50 a month for a Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>

<h4 id="wordpress-website">WordPress Website</h4>

<h5 id="fundraising-1">Fundraising</h5>

<p>WordPress can use any of the platform list for static site, but WordPress has a popular Plug-in called WooCommerce that will cost less because it can use many payment gateway. Setting up <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;q=setting+up+WooCommerce&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6-qi9tL3RAhWEORQKHdbGAtEQvwUIGSgA&amp;biw=1182&amp;bih=731">WooCommerce in WordPress has be covered</a> in-depth, and since all the themes that are available are built with WooComerce in mind the biggest decision is the payment gateway, which unlike static website tools very on fee structure. While there are many the 2 I would recommend are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.Net</a></p>

    <p>More than 400,000 merchants worldwide use Authorize.Net payment gateway – that accepts online payments through credit cards and electronic checks. You need to pay $49 as setup fees and $29 as monthly gateway fees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/payflow-payment-gateway">PayPal</a></p>

    <p>It’s one of the most widely-used payment gateways that accepts both credit card or debit card payments. It’s free to use for buyers. However store owners will have to pay a simple transition fees of “3.4% + $0.30 USD”, when using PayPal for credit card payments. This payment gateway does not require any setup fees, gateway fees, or monthly fees.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There are many more payment gateways out there and there could be better ones for you. Since not all the payment gateways functions in the same manner, it’s crucial to make the right choice. Below are a few factors you should consider, while figuring out which payment gateway you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check out the transition fees associated with a payment gateway. Make sure that it falls within your budget.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evaluate whether the payment gateway require you to go through a signup process. If yes, then it’s better to avoid such payment gateways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look out for payment gateway comes with multi-currency support, especially when you want to expand your online business globally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to know what products (digital or physical) you can sell, check out the terms and conditions of the payment gateways. That’s because, some may only allow selling physical goods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check out whether your payment gateway accept credit card, debit card and PayPal payments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that the payment gateway does not require your users to fill up unnecessary fields and so on.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This set-up biggest drawback is that you loss the reporting tools that come with the built for fundraising platforms, and while this might seem like a large issue there isn’t much you do with excel, practice, and time can’t overcome.</p>

<h5 id="email-1">Email</h5>

<p>Most Email vendors will have WordPress plugins, and just like with a Static Site you should go with MailChimp at first and expand from there.</p>

<h5 id="blog-1">Blog</h5>

<p>WordPress was built as a blogging platform so it comes with all the tools need to publish a blog post from a WYSIWYG editor in a way to easily add images and video’s. The only thing you need to keep in mind is to make sure that your blog is in a subfolder <code class="highlighter-rouge">example.com/blog</code> not a subdomain <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog.example.com</code></p>

<h5 id="hosting-1">Hosting</h5>

<p>The biggest hurdle for a WordPress site is hosting. Because it is a dynamic website, we can’t use the hosting options on the static site. While there are cheaper options out there the issues will arise right as your content goes viral this often will cause the site to become unusable so it is best to invest from the start so when you strike gold you can.

<h1 id="foundation-of-your-digital-strategy-why-you-need-a-blog">Foundation of your digital Strategy (Why You Need a Blog)</h1>

<p>Up until this point we have talked about having a blog, but haven’t really explained why. The reason why you need a blog is very simple it is the best platform for you to get your voice out, because while Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and SnapChat might have more users they limit your content too much and should be as platforms to promote your content from your blog. Great example of this is every digital facing issue advocacy group like <a href="https://twitter.com/hrc">Humans Rights Campaign</a>. This type of blog based strategy is Content Marketing and is one of the main pillars of digital.</p>

<h3 id="content-is-king">Content Is King</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220587">is</a> <a href="https://www.clickz.com › Social › Community Management">an often said</a> <a href="http://mobilemarketingwatch.com/why-content-marketing-is-the-king-of-digital-marketing-69443/">mantra</a> in digital marketing for good reason. <strong>Quality content</strong> will drive traffic and help you create a broader organization narrative beyond your mission statement and about page. For an Online Activist Group there a 3 types of content that will help your effort.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Press Release: Should be short and act as announcements for the Organization, such as fundraising number or upcoming event. While a lot of people will copy the text into twitter it is better to link to it with a twitter card, and retweet it multiply time through the day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical: Are either research, or policy on your issue. While reporting on other research or policy initiatives is ok. It is better for you to do original work, which is often a key component to this type of content getting shared.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Narrative: This is a personal story that talks about the effects of not acting on your issue, and should try to create an emotional connection with an uplifting ending.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consumer psychologist Dr Brent Coker from the University of Melbourne has identified four key elements present in viral videos, and revealed four common factors:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Sharability’ on social media. The video content must make the sharer look good to their peers.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Viewers must be able to connect to the content. Activating memories via music and nostalgia are key to getting the audience to connect to the video.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Large emotional range. Clips that quickly take the viewer from an emotional low (sadness or unfairness) to an emotional high (joy, love or justice) are more likely to go viral.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>‘Frisson’ or primitive feeling of excitement or thrill. There is often a physical response to a viral video, hairs standing on the back of the neck and goosebumps.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><cite>Source <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-03-recipe-video-viralresearch-key-ingredients.html">phys.org</a><cite></cite></cite></p>

<p>While the 4 points look at video the first can early be applied to blogs and depending on what social media platforms you use videos are always an option.</p>

<p>When you look at what social media platforms to use it is best to use Facebook plus one other to start with, but don’t forget to register your name for every social media platform so no can take it. The major reason for using only 2 platforms to start with is because it is better to do Facebook and SnapChat well than to be on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, interest, SnapChat, YouTube, and LinkedIn.</p>

<h6 id="warning-about-twitter">Warning About Twitter</h6>

<p>Twitter is one of the best platforms and might have more reach than Facebook given how content can go viral much quicker, and can spread outside of a group more easily. That being said, you are more likely to face trolls and bot driven harassment. When you choose a platform make sure that you have a well thought out policy because on Twitter not knowing who to respond to and how to respond can lead you to causing your problems, and alienating support.</p>

<h3 id="in-my-experience">In My Experience</h3>

<p>The most <strong>important</strong> thing to remember is <strong>Fundraising</strong> will always be <strong>number one</strong> in terms of how you prioritize, but if you keep your cost down, explore every option before deciding, and stay local you will be able to move past fundraising quickly and on to getting support for your issue and you can start making progress. Also most of the work you will be doing is grunt work that can seem pointless, but for every campaign I have worked on the basic grunt work is what leads us to better targeting and a more effective effort. This is why i recommend using spread sheets in the begin because they are a low cost solution, and aren’t functionally different from vendor solution for volunteer management and fundraising they just have a nicer user interface.</p>
