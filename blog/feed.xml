        <title>Fundraising Plan (1 of 2)</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series, we will walk through how to write a successful fundraising plan for your next campaign. In Part 1, we’ll take a look at why you need a plan, where you start with fundraising, and cover the two most important parts. In &lt;a href=&quot;../fundraising-plan-2&quot; rel=&quot;next&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; we will be going through the 6 components that are needed for a strong and achievable fundraising plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-your-campaign-needs-a-fundraising-plan&quot;&gt;Why Your Campaign Needs a Fundraising Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundraising plan is vital to success of any modern campaign, even the most local, but too often candidates assume once they get their campaign off the ground the money will start rolling, and take care of itself. They could not be farther from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campaigns run on money and even in the best Public Financing system you will need to get contributions to fund the campaign’s activities, this is by far the hardest part of any campaign. A successful fundraising effort will require the campaign in general, and the candidate in particular to spend quality time planning and execution a fundraising plan. &lt;strong&gt;The Candidate should spend a minimum 50% of their time fundraising&lt;/strong&gt; no matter level you’re running for - local, state, or federal - from my fundraising experience will be the deciding factor because if you don’t have the funds you can’t run a competitive campaign. That is why I always suggest &lt;strong&gt;writing out your fundraising plan before you launch your campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, and remember that your plan is a living document and can change during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-comes-first---fundraising-plan-or-campaign-strategy&quot;&gt;What Comes First - Fundraising Plan or Campaign Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While having a well developed fundraising plan is a key to a successful campaign I often am asked by candidates and campaign managers what comes first the campaign strategy or the fundraising plan. Another way of putting it is does a campaign figure out how much it can raise them build a plan around it, or do they figure a &lt;a href=&quot;../Campaign-Plan/&quot;&gt;winning campaign strategy&lt;/a&gt; and then figure out how to fund it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience it is the latter, &lt;strong&gt;your campaign should figure out what it will take to win&lt;/strong&gt; because if you need to raise $500,000 to win and you aren’t able to create a reasonable fundraising plan to match then I would suggest sitting out this cycle or looking at a different race. Also in past races I have been involved with large donors like to know how their money will be spent, and a campaign strategy is the only way to show that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;first-step-for-political-fundraising---finance-committee&quot;&gt;First Step for Political Fundraising - Finance committee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name “Finance Committee” can be deceiving because the committee isn’t really responsible for executing the fundraising. That task is for the candidate, campaign manager, campaign staff, and in larger races Finance Director. The role of the Finance Committee is to provide contacts who can be solicited for donations, and provides a starting point for the campaign’s political fundraising network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key elements that each member of the Finance Committee are that they have a wide range of contacts they can solicit to support the candidate, which should go without saying the members should be some of your strongest supporters, and have already donated to the campaign. To keep the members accountable you should get commitments or pledges about how much they will raise. The committee can be cured from a large spectrum of people from local businessmen, professionals, socialites, and political contact among other. &lt;strong&gt;The only requirement is that they have supported the candidate financially and have a gold Rolodex with multiple people who can also donate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;political-fundraising-network&quot;&gt;Political Fundraising Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to fundraising local candidates are unlikely to national money and PAC contributions, and for the handful of candidate that do they are few and far between. For a candidate to then be successful the candidate, staff, and finance committee must be ruthless when it comes to using their contacts. This means when the campaign goes through their contacts they have to be will go beyond close friends and family and reach out to everyone in their social circles from school alumni to PTA and acquaintances from church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your list the candidate has to make the call. This is because every donor like personal contact, which means that the candidate will get more “Yes” then a campaign staffer. That being said spouses and family members are a close second because &lt;strong&gt;the key is using personal contact to make “potential contributors” into “regular contributors”&lt;/strong&gt;, and the best way is to make them feel like they have access and a connection to the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-keys-to-a-successful-political-fundraising-plan&quot;&gt;The keys to a Successful Political Fundraising Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most important things that political campaigns fail to put into their fundraising plans are &lt;strong&gt;deadlines and responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;. Every fundraising plan needs to have a list of deadlines for the event followed by action that need to be taken on certain days, which then are assigned a person who will be responsible for carrying out the action so the political campaign can meet its deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example you might create a schedule that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Campaign Kick Off Fundraising Event - 7/2&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Form host committee - 5/15 - John&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Secure venue - 5/20 - Jane&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Send out invitations - 6/1 - John&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make follow up calls - 6/10 - Jane, John and Committee&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Finalize event details - 6/20 - Jane&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Final follow-up calls - 6/28 - Jane and John&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that you can fill in staffing areas with campaign staff or volunteers the key is to &lt;strong&gt;make sure that you have a concrete action plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will guide the person or persons that are in charge of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Website Platforms for you Political and Advocacy Campaign</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a lot of options for a website for your political and advocacy campaign keeping it simple with a static site or a Wordpress site is the best option. We will be looking at both options and the tools that can be used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;low-cost-website&quot;&gt;Low-Cost Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##### Fundraising&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two tools that are non-partisan that can be used by any political or issue campaign:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://politics.raisethemoney.com/&quot;&gt;Raise the Money&lt;/a&gt;
  The one of the advantages to this fundraising platform is that is embedded in your site, which makes it feel more professional, but it the most expensive at 4.9% + $.25 transaction fee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://transaxt.com/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Transaxt&lt;/a&gt;
  The advantage to Transaxt is that it the cheapest non-partisan platform, but it will require user to go to a Transaxt subdomain making it look less professional and moving off your website. The transition fee is less the Raise the Money with a 4.5% transition fee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also partisan platforms, and while I have only used Revv both APIs will work with static sites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partisan options
  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://revv.co/&quot;&gt;Revv&lt;/a&gt;
  This is a Republican and Conservative platform that allows you to embed the API on your site with 4% + $.30 transaction fee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.actblue.com/&quot;&gt;ActBlue&lt;/a&gt;
  This is a Democratic and Liberal platform that has the lowest transition fee at 3.95%, but the user will leave the site to make the donation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a blog for a static site use to be difficult, but over the last few years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staticgen.com/&quot;&gt;Static Site Generators&lt;/a&gt; have made maintain a blog relatively simple. The most popular is Jekyll, but it was built to be used with a Mac so if you are on Windows make sure you take a look at the alternatives because setting up Jekyll can be difficult. If you are looking to set up a Jekyll site you cab make make it act like a &lt;a href=&quot;../static-site-cms/&quot;&gt;CRM with a few simple steps&lt;/a&gt;, and should be placed in a subfolder ie. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; as your blog platform, which has a few advantages. The biggest benefit is that because it is built around a social media platform, so it has tools to help disseminate your content to the right people right away. The other one is that people don’t need any technology skills because it uses a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor. If you do go this route try to buy &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.blog&lt;/code&gt; of your domain because you will be unable to set-up the blog in a subfolder or subdomain, and can use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.blog&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214110127-About-custom-domains&quot;&gt;domain for your Medium&lt;/a&gt; blog, and redirect visitor from your main page. The biggest downside is that you don’t have control over the blog layout or features so it is less customizable, and will be harder to raise money off or collect emails from an article .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;hosting&quot;&gt;Hosting&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options for hosting a static Website from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; which is free to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2424725,00.asp&quot;&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; that can cost between $1.00 a month for a basic shared hosting to $50 a month for a Virtual Private Server (VPS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;high-cost-website&quot;&gt;High-Cost Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##### Fundraising&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress can use any of the platform list for static site &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;plus thousands more&lt;/a&gt;, but WordPress has a popular Plug-in called WooCommerce that will cost less because it can use many payment gateway. Setting up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;amp;q=setting+up+WooCommerce&amp;amp;spell=1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6-qi9tL3RAhWEORQKHdbGAtEQvwUIGSgA&amp;amp;biw=1182&amp;amp;bih=731&quot;&gt;WooCommerce in WordPress has be covered&lt;/a&gt; in-depth, and since all the themes that are available are built with WooComerce in mind the biggest decision is the payment gateway, which unlike static website tools can very greatly, but will cost less then the fundraising platforms above. While there are many the 2 I would recommend are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.authorize.net/&quot;&gt;Authorize.Net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More than 400,000 merchants worldwide use Authorize.Net payment gateway – that accepts online payments through credit cards and electronic checks. You need to pay $49 as setup fees and $29 as monthly gateway fees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/payflow-payment-gateway&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s one of the most widely-used payment gateways that accepts both credit card or debit card payments. It’s free to use for buyers. However store owners will have to pay a simple transition fees of “3.4% + $0.30 USD”, when using PayPal for credit card payments. This payment gateway does not require any setup fees, gateway fees, or monthly fees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set-up biggest drawback is that you loss the reporting tools that come with the built for fundraising platforms, and while this might seem like a large issue there isn’t much you do with excel, practice, and time can’t overcome when it comes to campaign finance reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;blog-1&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress was built as a blogging platform so it comes with all the tools need to publish a blog post from a WYSIWYG editor in a way to easily add images and video’s. The only thing you need to keep in mind is to make sure that your blog is in a subfolder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/blog&lt;/code&gt; not a subdomain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;hosting-1&quot;&gt;Hosting&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest hurdle for a WordPress site is hosting. Because it is a dynamic website, we can’t use the hosting options on the static site. While there are cheaper options out there the issues will arise right as your content goes viral this often will cause the site to become unusable so it is best to invest from the start so when you strike gold you can. This topic has been covered by most WordPress based sites below is further reading on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/142649/is-there-a-real-benefit-in-using-wordpress-optimized-hosting&quot;&gt;Is there a real benefit in using wordpress optimized hosting?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools-and-services&quot;&gt;Tools and Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the popularity of Wordpress when you choose a tool or services for you political or advocacy campaign it will always be available. So the tools and services are targeted for those who choose to use a static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/&quot;&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt; is the most common tool used by local campaign websites because it has the best free option compared to the other email deliver systems, but if you know you will be going to a pay tier early on then there are many option these two I have used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aweber.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Aweber.png&quot; alt=&quot;Aweber Logo&quot; /&gt; AWeber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starts at $19/mo for 0-500 Subscribers, but offers unlimited emails along with premium features that are left off other low-cost tiers like segmenting which can help with retargeting outreach to supporters or donors of the political or issue campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignmonitor.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/campaignMonitor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Campaign Monitor Logo&quot; /&gt; Campaign Monitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starts at $9/mo for 0-500 Subscribers, but limits you to only 2,500 email a month. To have unlimited emails you have to go to the next tier at $29/mo and to get all the features of Aweber you will need their Premier at $149/mo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;form&quot;&gt;Form&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other crucial service you will need if you are launching a political or advocacy campaign website is a way for supporters to reach out to you, and while a community comment section can seem like a good idea it will only lead to harassment and trolling from the opposition even if you use Disqus or Facebook Community. That is why I have always used a form on our campaign websites so we can move the conversation to email or offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only one I have used is &lt;a href=&quot;https://formspree.io/&quot;&gt;formspree.io&lt;/a&gt;. Formspree will allow you to place a form on your campaign website and have the responses forwarded to an email account, but your campaign can only receive 1000 submissions per email each month. If you would like to have more submissions they have a Gold Plan for $10/mo that will also give you a dashboard to help manage the submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting It all Together&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the information laid out thought the article you should be able to get you advocacy or political campaign off the ground, but it is just the start &lt;strong&gt;you will need to set up an organization with your state or federal government&lt;/strong&gt; so you can legally fundraise for your campaign. But the one thing you have to understand about an organizing an advocacy campaign online is that tweets, shares, signup, and web traffic does not equal votes at the ballot or in the legislature. So you will need to create a &lt;a href=&quot;../Campaign-Plan/&quot;&gt;campaign plan&lt;/a&gt; to move from the internet to the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The West Coast Effect</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West Coast Effect is the term given to an election controversy that date back to the 1960’s when the national broadcast started. This controversy centers around early reporting on the east coast and the impact it has on west coast voters. While the commonly studied effect on west coast voter didn’t have an effect on 2016 early voting reports might have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first research into in the West Cost effect was done in the 1966 election (Fuchs, 1966; Mendelsohn, 1966; Lang &amp;amp; Lang, 1968), and found to be no evidence of the effect of early reporting, but it had a few problems. One of the issues was that all three studies assume that voter made a decision on election, which is known to only be a few. The voters in the studies only showed that pre-election polls would have caused the west coast voters to stay home, then only hear about a Goldwater upset because that would have changed the results. The other problem was that they ignore the central question of what the effect on the local level. And the biggest one was that the 1966 election was never close so the east coast vote total provided no new information to west coast voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the three Lang &amp;amp; Lang’s book &lt;strong&gt;Voting and Nonvoting: Implications of Broadcasting Returns Before Polls Are Closed&lt;/strong&gt; (1968) was more far-reaching and was considered the definitive study for over a decade. The survey was limited to, Oakland county and the members surveyed (438) resulted large margin of error, and once the early voter were eliminated there slightly more the 100 making the study inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980’s there was a second wave of research on the West Cost Effect, which included multiple studies. Of the studies three of the studies (Delli Carpini, 1984; Dubois, 1983; Epstein &amp;amp; Strom, 1981) used aggregate date rather than surveys to overcome the lack of a sufficient data pool, while (Jackson, 1983) used a much larger survey. While Epstein &amp;amp; Strom (1981), Dubois (1983), and Delli Carpini (1984) used aggregate data, they all chose different details from Epstein and Strom (1981) using regional turnout data (West Coast, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain states, etc.), Dubois (1983) using state level turnout, and Delli Carpini (1984) using congressional districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Epstein &amp;amp; Strom determined that the results were inconclusive. Both Delli Carpini and Dubois found there to be an effect, but Dubois argued this was a unique effect of the 1980 election. Jackson (1983) was different from the other studies because it was able to address the issue of information access, which the other 3 ignored. Because Jackson used a survey from the University of Michigan’s Presidential Election Study and from the Vote Validation Study by the Center for Political Studies he was able to create a pool of 1814 persons who were interviewed both before and after the election. Jackson found that the combination of access to early election returns and hearing Carter’s concession speech reduced turnout between six and twelve percent. There was little evidence, however, that either party was disproportionately affected, but because of statistical errors and among other problems it decrease confidence in the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent study by Peterson (2004) looks to address voter access to information that past studies have ignored. He was able to show a direct effect of early reporting with the average turnout for the informed participants were 31.2%, while it was 71.5% of the uninformed participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/west-coast-effect/west-bar-graph-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;West Coast Effect Figure showing voter turnout between informed and uninformed participants&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also found that among informed participants that turnout dropped by 19.1% based off of earlier reports, but favored the candidate that lost on the East Coast because those participants turnout dropped only 8.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/west-coast-effect/west-bar-graph-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;West Coast Effect Figure showing voter turnout between favorable news and unfavorable news&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of Peterson (2004) study shows us that the West Coast effect occurs, and participants who had access to the early election returns were significantly and consistently more likely to stay home than uninformed participants. In the second part Peterson (2004) looked at the effect if one candidate always had the support of a majority of the potential voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/west-coast-effect/west-bar-graph-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;West Coast Effect With one Candidate having support of a majority&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found when the information supports the majority candidate that informed voters weren’t effective, but uninformed voter turnout decreased slightly from 65% to 59% for majority supporters and decreased from 37% to 25%. When information about the minority candidate show them winning or tiring on the east coast, then minority supports increase from 33% to 55%, while turnout from the supporters of the majority candidate plummeted from 42% to 13%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;effect-on-2016&quot;&gt;Effect on 2016&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the studies are inconclusive the effect on early reporting does have the possibility to affect the outcome of the race and given a headline during and right after early voting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-early-voting-20161027-story.html&quot;&gt;Millions of people have voted, and Democrats are showing strong signs in key states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on top of the early reporting the voter that did come out to vote were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/how-hillary-clinton-lost-florida-hint-it-happened-on-election-day/2305224&quot;&gt;Super Voters&lt;/a&gt; so when election day came around and everyone from Fox News to MSNBC said that Clinton was in a strong position to win the low prospect voters decided not to show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the election a lot has been said about how Donald Trump won, but when looking at what happened in Michigan and Wisconsin with voter turnout dropping 0.2% and 3.4%, respectively the effects of early reporting should be taken seriously even if the results are inconclusive. Moving forward surveys looking to study the West Coast Effect should move beyond early reporting on election day and examine the effects of early reporting from early voting and the effect it has on election day turnout.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starting a Digital Activist Group</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best places to start an activist group is online because it allows for you to start organizing with low fixed costs. In this article we will talk about the basic to start an online political or issues based campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;starting-the-campaign&quot;&gt;Starting the Campaign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start any political or issue campaign you have to choose a scoop, and while most people what to start and organize nationwide the problem comes down to scale because while a national organization saying they have 750,000 members might seem impressive, but they have no real influence because their support will be spread across 50 states, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_television_stations_in_North_America_by_media_market&quot;&gt;210 designated market areas&lt;/a&gt;, 435 congressional districts, which have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;amp;q=average+number+of+voter+per+congressional+districts&amp;amp;oq=average+number+of+voter+per+congressional+districts&amp;amp;gs_l=serp.3...24138.29411.0.29511.28.28.0.0.0.0.105.2044.23j3.26.0....0...1.1.64.serp..3.9.662...0i7i30k1j0i8i7i30k1j0i8i30k1.kjDV6DeEVkk&quot;&gt;approximately 700,000 voters &lt;/a&gt; each, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9799/2971&quot;&gt;3,141 counties and county equivalents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that you will have to keep in mind is cost because the more you spend on basics (IE. website, lists, and services) the more you will have to raise before you can spend on advocacy. So it is best to start locally and grow from there, but no matter what the scale of the organization is you will first need is a Website to be your digital outreach base for your political or advocacy campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-up-and-running&quot;&gt;Getting Up and Running&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you will need is a website to bass your digital campaign outreach from. The website doesn’t have to be complicated it can be a simple static website hosted for free by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, but should &lt;strong&gt;include email sign up, donate, and a blog for your content&lt;/strong&gt;. It will also help if you familiarize yourself with a Spread Sheet program because this will be how you will organize your data (. IE volunteers, social media IDs, donor records) at the beginning of your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;thing-to-keep-in-mind&quot;&gt;Thing to Keep in Mind&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may seem easier to use an all-in one system like NationBuilder the problem is that most of the tools are ad-ones, and the ones that aren’t have free equivalents like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meshfire.com/&quot;&gt;MeshFire&lt;/a&gt; for social media listening tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to keep in mind is that pivot tables are a strong tool that are included in spreadsheet programs and can handle the volume of data you will have at the beginning. So make sure that you know the full cost before you start with an all-in one service because it can add unnecessary cost to you campaign in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-one&quot;&gt;Step One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first thing you will need to do is obtain a &lt;a href=&quot;../domain-name/&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; the best place to start is &lt;a href=&quot;http://domains.google/&quot;&gt;Google Domain&lt;/a&gt; because places like GoDaddy will buy the domain name that you search for through their website forcing you to use them. &lt;strong&gt;Once you have the domain name make sure to claim it on every social media account&lt;/strong&gt; from Facebook to GitHub any anything else you can think of. This step is to make sure that people don’t assume your organization identity on a platform you don’t use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;website-basics&quot;&gt;Website Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic cost of a website depends on how much you are willing to do yourself. The cheapest option will be creating a static website for the landing page, and use a Static Site Generator like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to maintain a blog. While this way is by far the cheapest you will need to know how to build a simple website, and be able to integrate some third party services. Another option is to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; site. The biggest benefit of this solution is that you don’t need to know anything about a website. This is because every web host has 1 click WordPress set-up, and there is plenty of theme market place like &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/&quot;&gt;Themeforest&lt;/a&gt; that have non-for profit and campaign web themes. The biggest problem is cost because while you can host a WordPress site for $5 per month it will crash the moment you go viral, and the only way to avoid the problem is to spend any where from $50 to $250 a month on hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;digital-campaign-strategy-why-you-need-a-blog&quot;&gt;Digital Campaign Strategy (Why You Need a Blog)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until this point we have talked about having a blog, but haven’t really explained why. The reason why you need a blog is very simple it is the best platform for you to get your voice out, because while Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and SnapChat might have more users they limit your content too much and should be as platforms to promote your content from your blog. Great example of this is every digital facing issue advocacy group like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hrc&quot;&gt;Humans Rights Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. This type of blog based strategy is Content Marketing and is one of the main pillars of digital advocacy campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-create-content&quot;&gt;How to Create Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220587&quot;&gt;Content Is King&lt;/a&gt; is an often said mantra in digital marketing for good reason. &lt;strong&gt;Quality content will drive traffic&lt;/strong&gt;  and help you create a broader organization narrative beyond your mission statement and about page. For an Online Activist Group and Political and Issue Campaign there a 3 types of content that will help your effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Press Release: Should be short and act as announcements for the Organization, such as fundraising number or upcoming event. While a lot of people will copy the text into twitter it is better to link to it with a twitter card, and retweet it multiply time through the day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical: Are either research, or policy on your issue. While reporting on other research or policy initiatives is ok. It is better for you to do original work, which is often a key component to this type of content getting shared.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Narrative: This is a personal story that talks about the effects of not acting on your issue, and should try to create an emotional connection with an uplifting ending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Consumer psychologist Dr Brent Coker from the University of Melbourne has identified four key elements present in viral videos, and revealed four common factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Shareability’ on social media. The video content must make the sharer look good to their peers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Viewers must be able to connect to the content. Activating memories via music and nostalgia are key to getting the audience to connect to the video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Large emotional range. Clips that quickly take the viewer from an emotional low (sadness or unfairness) to an emotional high (joy, love or justice) are more likely to go viral.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‘Frisson’ or primitive feeling of excitement or thrill. There is often a physical response to a viral video, hairs standing on the back of the neck and goosebumps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2016-03-recipe-video-viralresearch-key-ingredients.html&quot;&gt;phys.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the 4 points look at video the first can easily be applied to blogs and depending on what social media platforms you use videos are always an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-content-local&quot;&gt;Keep Content Local&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have decided to keep your effort locally then you will need to make sure that your content is local also. This means focusing less on national news and more about local councils. By writing local you are letting search engines know that your activist organization is for a local cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help the most for what search engines view as local searches some examples of search treated as local are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where to vote on election day&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When does early voting start&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where to volunteer&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and while most people have seen Google answer these questions throughout the Presidential Election they still don’t cover municipal and special elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-media&quot;&gt;Social media&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at what social media platforms to use it is &lt;strong&gt;best to use Facebook plus one other&lt;/strong&gt; to start with, but don’t forget to register your name for every social media platform so no can take it. The major reason for using only 2 platforms to start with is because it is better to do Facebook and SnapChat well compared to be on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, interest, SnapChat, YouTube, and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose for using &lt;strong&gt;social media is to engage with your supporters&lt;/strong&gt; and help your campaign disseminate content from your blog. The best way to do that is to reach out to influencers to share your content with their larger following with the hope they follow your account. The &lt;strong&gt;key goal is to drive traffic to your site&lt;/strong&gt; so the user completes an action like to donate or sign-up for a newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warning-about-twitter&quot;&gt;Warning About Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is one of the best platforms and might have more reach than Facebook given how content can go viral much quicker, and can spread outside of a group more easily. That being said, you are more likely to face trolls and bot driven harassment. When you choose a platform make sure that you have a well thought out &lt;a href=&quot;../social-media-policy/&quot;&gt;social media policy&lt;/a&gt; because on Twitter not knowing who to respond to and how to respond can lead you to causing your problems, and alienating support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;digital-fundraising&quot;&gt;Digital Fundraising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you start fundraising make sure that you are following your state laws for issue and political organizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main tool for digital fundraising will be your email list. While most people think it is social media that assumption is wrong. The ALS Association Ice Bucket Challenge went viral it was the exception most campaigns &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/12/02/458008461/a-click-too-far-why-social-media-isnt-that-great-for-fundraising&quot;&gt;2% of their donation referrals&lt;/a&gt; from social media. The best online examples fundraising through emails are President Donald Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders shows how strong it can be. The key takeaway from both of their campaigns are that you should &lt;strong&gt;ask often and create a sense of urgency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../digital-fundraising/&quot;&gt;Intro to Digital Fundraising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;putting-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting All Together&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your campaign website and social media accounts up and running the last step you will have to do is put it all together. This means that you should start working on content to populate your advocacy site, and try to schedule a set number of post and tweets each week. You will also have to start with your social media outreach to influencers to help get your content to the right people to grow your following in a meaningful way. &lt;strong&gt;Make sure you set clear and achievable goal&lt;/strong&gt; so that you measure the success of each action so you know what works best for your advocacy organization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Static Site CMS with GitHub</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be going over how to create a content management system (CMS) using &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;. This workflow will create a CMS that is built on the Static Site Generator &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. This guide &lt;strong&gt;DOES NOT require Jekyll to be set up or any knowledge of Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-up&quot;&gt;Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text editor we recommended here at Digital Roots is &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; because it comes with a markdown previewer which will allow have a What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor, which is one of the biggest drawbacks to using a static site generator over a traditional CMS like Word Press. It also works well with GitHub Desktops because it will automatically track chances between you version on GitHub and the one saved to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt; and sign-up on the front page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/github-landingpage.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub Landing Page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;github-desktop&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To set up GitHub Desktop go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;desktop.github.com&lt;/a&gt; and download the version for you Operating System (OS)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/github-desktop-landingpage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Landing Page of GitHub Desktop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have GitHub Desktop installed. Return to GitHub and go to the git repository(repo) for you site hosted on GitHub Pages. Todo this enter the site repo in the search, and follow the link to your repo.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/github-nav-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;Navigating to site repository&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/github-search-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nav search results&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reaching the repository you will download the repository to GitHub Desktops&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/github-repository-dowloading.png&quot; alt=&quot;Downloading repository&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;client-editable&quot;&gt;Client Editable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to most static site workflows is that they allow users to edit every file on the site this can cause problems if they edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.css&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt;, and the problems seem to get worse with preprocessors. With GitHub we are able to have control over which files are added, this is because GitHub is primarily used as version control system for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;client-workflow&quot;&gt;Client workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a Fork by going to the button left button title masters&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/fork-in-github-desktop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fork the repository&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To open the Project in Atom right click on the folder in GitHub Desktop&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/open-project-Gitdesktop-atom.png&quot; alt=&quot;opening in atom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a new post in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory and fill out the relevant YAML fields (fields  between &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; at the top of the post), and right click the file in atom to open the markdown preview to see your post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/view-of-atom.png&quot; alt=&quot;View of Atom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have written the post fill in the summary and description in GitHub Desktop and commit&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/Gihub-CRM/github-desktop-commit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Filling out commit in GitHub Desktop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you commit it send a pull request&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Client has followed those steps then the post can be uploaded to the site stoping any mistakes the client might have done due to access to the site files.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twitterbots and Campaigns</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With social media proving itself to be worth an investment and integration at the start of a campaign, there are still a lot of decisions that a campaign will have to make that go beyond a &lt;a href=&quot;../social-media-policy/&quot;&gt;social media policy and strategy&lt;/a&gt;. The decisions that go beyond strategy and policy include paid vs organic outreach and whether or not you are going to use bots to help you with your online presence, which recent research has shown can have a meaningful effect even in some of the largest campaigns. Philip Howard, Professor of Internet Studies at the Oxford Internet Institute, comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘We can’t say who was behind the highly automated pro-Trump accounts but they were purposeful, thoughtful and deliberate about when to release messages, what those messages should be, and what their targets were. We found similarities in the rhythm of the pro-Trump Twitter campaign and that successfully employed by the Leave campaign in the run up to the EU referendum in the UK.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A USC study has also shown the scale of these bots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that Twitter bot accounts produced 3.8 million tweets, or 19 percent of all election tweets for the study’s period. Social bots also accounted for 400,000 of the 2.8 million individual users tweeting about the election, or nearly 15 percent of the population under study.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USC study goes further than just the presence of bots and looks at the sentiment of each message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;on a scale ranging from minus 4 (maximum negativity) to plus 4 (maximum positivity), generated by both bot and human tweets during this time. Both human and bot tweets about Trump were almost uniformly positive when compared to those about Clinton, which were equally neutral and positive.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though President-Elect Donald Trump was having a large amount of negative news in print and on television it seems that having a uniformly positive message on twitter. This helped balance the message that was being driven offline, and in contrast, Hillary Clinton had a twitter army that was a lot more balanced. The difference here can create a stark difference given bits are a large driver of online discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bots produce content automatically, and therefore at a very fast and continuous rate. That means they form consistent and pervasive parts of the online discussion throughout the campaign. As a result, they were able to build significant influence, collecting large numbers of followers and having their tweets retweeted by thousands of humans.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constant presence along with a large number of followers is what gives beats the ability to be empowered by the “illusory truth effect”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Psychological research, including my own, shows that repeated exposure to false information can change people’s beliefs that is it true. This phenomenon is called the “illusory truth effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This effect happens to us all – including people who know the truth. Our research suggests that even people who knew Pope Francis made no presidential endorsement would be susceptible to believing a “Pope endorses Trump” headline when they had seen it multiple times. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While twitter bots have been attributed in having an effect on an election, there still isn’t much data to know if there is any real impact, but thanks to the Python Library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/esdalmaijer/markovbot&quot;&gt;Markovbot&lt;/a&gt; it is possible to set-up and try for both local and state based races. The only things you keep in mind are: 1. What kind of bot will do(ie. retweet, post new content, respond other members) 2. what will be your keywords, target string an conversation depth 3. When will it start and stop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you set the twitter bolt upright and make sure they have a positive and promoting message for the candidate or organization, then it will have the best opponent to have an impact on the election,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Volunteer Relations System</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Volunteers are the life blood or non-for profits, campaigns, and political parties, and while where and how you recruit them is important keeping motivated and involved not just through the campaign, but in between is important to making sure hat you have the support to make the calls and knock the doors to win. Here at Digital Roots has written about how to &lt;a href=&quot;../recruit/&quot;&gt;identify and manage volunteer&lt;/a&gt;, but we have never talked about how to build a system that will help you retain first time volunteers and keep them through the winter and off cycle slumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-a-program&quot;&gt;The Case for a Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When maintaining volunteers there are a number of challenges that every organization faces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reducing ‘churn’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engaging or growing current volunteering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing loyalty to the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are best faced with a loyalty program because there are a number of advantages over the average volunteers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay active over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More likely to suggest people volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend more time volunteering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-building-the-system&quot;&gt;How to Building the System&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each system will be different in a number of key ways there are some rules of thumbs to make sure that the program is successful. The key parts are broken down into the key element of every loyalty program and the mechanics that make the program function on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loyalty-levers&quot;&gt;Loyalty Levers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rewards&quot;&gt;Rewards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rewards are the backbone of the system and can be the most difficult. The rewards can be done in a few ways, but they revolve around accumulating points so that you can receive an award. The points system can be a as simple as receiving the reward after you reach a certain number of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this is Duncan Donuts were once you acquire 200 points you are automatically issued a coupon for a free drink. Or as complicated as the ones most hotel use where you can exchange points like cash for food drinks and discount rooms. Unlike Duncan Donuts these systems allow for greater choice for the user, and create a more customized experience through the different services. The tradeoff for these systems is that changing the system can cause a friction point with your supporters making it harder to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recognition&quot;&gt;Recognition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is what keeps people engaged in the program this is because it allow the individual to feel like they are making progress by reaching new levels or gathering badges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition though isn’t just a statics it also has to come with benefits that are more constant rather than one time. One of the most common examples is when loyalty program members get a preferred customer hotline. For some organization, it could be an extended early bird special for events and fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relevance&quot;&gt;Relevance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevance is what will help you get new members to join the program. This is by far one of the most important parts of the program because using the program can quickly become irrelevant if you can’t gain and active members that will use your loyalty program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest friction points are the forms to sign-up are too long and ask for for more information then need to start. The thing to remember is that you can always get more information from a member once they are active. The other fiction point of relevance is the rewards while it can be easy to avoid on simpler systems more complex ones will have to figure out what members what and what is relevant to the as their status and use of the program goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-kinds-of-loyalty&quot;&gt;Different Kinds of Loyalty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercenary&lt;/strong&gt; - were they are only loyal because it is the best offer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inertia&lt;/strong&gt; - were they stay in the program because they have already invest money or time(IE. money on a loyalty card)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt; - were they believe in the organization and don’t need to be incentivize to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most volunteers will get involved because they fall under true loyalty, but because there are often multiple organizations that advocate for similar issues we need to create inertia loyalty to try to get volunteers to prioritize our efforts over those of allied organizations, and give them a reason to stay on board after the first event (reduce churn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-part-to-a-program&quot;&gt;Basic Part to a Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 basic parts to every loyalty program, which are the currency, status, enrollment &amp;amp; activation, and partnerships. While most organizations have national, local, and state chapters the ability to do partnerships are limited because of the risk of sharing a volunteer list and the different laws. That is why it is best for organization with multiple levels of organizations should run the program at the state level and allow local branches to join the statewide program directly rather than working in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currency (Points) - This is the most significant decision in creating a loyalty program, and is the major supporter of the loyalty lever Reward. The two parts that need to be addressed is the member and organization side:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Decisions that effect Members:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;How can the currency be earned: It could be for social media activity or for canvassing and phone banking.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;How easy the process is to use them: Does the reward automatically trigger once reaching a certain value or does the person have to spend them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;What is the value of the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Decisions that effect Organization:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Breakage: ‘points’ earned by volunteers but are never used, typically stated as a percentage of the total.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Administrative Cost: annual costs associated with maintaining, and growing the program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reward Cost: financial value of any program award that a consumer receives and uses&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Status - is especially important element of a loyalty program because it creates value beyond the points system and supports the loyalty lever Recognition:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Statues have to mean something: That means the there should a desirable benefit for these “special volunteers”, and should be a continuing benefit unlike currency benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enrollment &amp;amp; Activation - All programs start with enrolling (acquiring) and activating (on-boarding) a new member done well it will support the loyalty lever Relevance. The key points are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make the process simple&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Minimize the information that is “required”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enable enrollment to happen across many channels.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tell them only what they need to get started&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracking-key-performance-indicators-kpi&quot;&gt;Tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPI)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference between private business and non-for profits is the KPIs. In business it is based around how much more a member spends. For non-for profits they could use a program for donations, but it would be better at attracting retaining and mobilizing voters. So the KPIs should be based events, voter contact, and volunteer referred rather than a monetary value or social media engagement (IE. reviews and generated content).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting your KPIs to focus on volunteers will have a larger return because investing in a grassroots program can be a time consuming and labor intensive effort. With a loyalty system is is well built you can reduce voluntary churn between election, allowing you to start more aggressively and spend more time growing from last year progress rather than rebuilding last year team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Maryland GOP | Site Audit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With 2016 over and 2018 being more crucial for Republicans in Maryland than ever I though it might be a good time to look at the Maryland GOP to see how their digital footprint looks. There are 5 part that I will be looking at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indexability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On-Page Ranking Factors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Off-Page Ranking Factors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competitive Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;maryland-republican-party---seo-audit&quot;&gt;Maryland Republican Party - SEO Audit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdgop.org/&quot;&gt;Maryland Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; has done the worst possible thing you can do for Search Engine Optimization and the is having your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalroots.io/blog/robots/&quot;&gt;robot.txt&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;

    User-Angent: *

    Disallow: /

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is telling all crawlers that they are not allowed on the site which keep Search Engines from indexing any pages. In the case of mdgop.org they still index for exact search words and phrases because of sites linking back to it, but it is for from ideal.
There robot.txt should look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
User-Agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /utils/
Disallow: /forms/
Disallow: /users/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, things start to look better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site seems to be fine there are no Robots Meta Tags, but because of the robots.txt the site that is index is a 404 error page. Also, they seem to have XML Sitemap, but don’t have it at in the footer. This is something that should be added because Google recommends it. They do avoid using Flash and JavaScript Navigation, which help the Crawlability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site architecture and performance is another mix bag. While the site architecture is simple and allows for easy access the site take a little over 4 seconds to load which &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/&quot;&gt;can cause problems&lt;/a&gt; they should enable compression, use browser caching, and minify files. On the mobile site they need to increase the size of social links so that they are fat finger friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indexability&quot;&gt;Indexability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;site-and-page-search&quot;&gt;Site and Page search&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalroots.io/blog/robots/&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; mdgop.org does index and has a reported 169 pages indexed, and on mdgop.org page search it shows up in position number one, but no other page shows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brand-search&quot;&gt;Brand Search&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These searches seem to have had a major effect from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalroots.io/blog/robots/&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; because the only mdgop domain that showed when I searched Maryland Republican Party, Maryland GOP and mdgop was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdgop.org/site/lookup.asp?c=9sILJXMCLdJ0H&amp;amp;b=5916197&quot;&gt;mdgop.com&lt;/a&gt; which was in position 5, 8 and 1 respectively but both lead to a 404 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/MDGOP-SERP-Maryland-Republican-Party.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Google SERP for Maryland Republican Party&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, because of Google My Business the Maryland Republican Party does show up on the right in the knowledge panel, but only when you search Maryland Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-page-ranking-factors&quot;&gt;On-Page Ranking Factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;urls&quot;&gt;URLs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdgop.org&quot;&gt;Maryland Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; site has a good url that contains relevant keywords, are short and user friendly, and avoids the most common problems with urls, but should use hyphens( - ) instead of underscores( _ ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Republican Party has regular post, but are lacking in length and have no keywords. Maryland GOP could try to use narrative post about what the party is currently doing in the community and have volunteers talk about how they got involved with the party. They could also answer questions “like where do I vote” and “how to run for office”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;keywords&quot;&gt;Keywords&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current Top 5 Keywords by traffic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Keyword&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Percent of Search Traffic&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1\. republican convention&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;44.97%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2\. maryland republican party&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;15.46%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3\. maryland gop&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;5.75%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;4\. maryland republican primary&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4.53%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;5\. maryland republican delegates&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4.31%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They seem to only be getting traffic from republican subject queries this likely means that they are only drawing in republican voters though search and should try to answer election questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ranking with keywords the most important measures are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drumbeatmarketing.net/marketing-blog/what-is-page-authority&quot;&gt;Page Authority(PA)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shoutmeloud.com/domain-authority.html&quot;&gt;Domain Authority(DA)&lt;/a&gt; mdgop.org is PA: 55/100 DA: 46/100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOP: Volume 300k - 1.5m Difficulty 83 Opportunity 64 Potential 80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 3 sites PA was between 49 - 86 and DA were between 84 - 100 for GOP making it hard to make meaningful gains, and because Google views it as a national keyword trying to use local key-phrases isn’t possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to vote: Volume 11.5k - 30.3l Difficulty 70 Opportunity 52 Potential 67&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 3 sites PA was 60 -71 and DA 57 - 75, but Google treats this a a local search to some degree so while it may be hard to rank nationally if they continue down the local search path it will be one of the easer key-phrases to rank with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to vote in Maryland: Volume 101 - 200 Difficulty 38 Opportunity 46 Potential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 3 site are the same without Maryland added. With Google looking at their query as a local search more this key-phrase will help you with local SEO, and during midterms the election is more likely to drive local searches over nation ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican Beliefs : Volume 4.3k - 6.5k Difficulty 31 Opportunity 64 Potential 72&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top sites Page Authority was between 24 - 25 and Domain Authority was between 22 - 36 for Republican Beliefs and while it has much less volume the ability to rank well for this keyword. It also is a keyword that will fit in naturally with narrative content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;html-markuphttpwwwdigitalrootsioblogseo-basics&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalroots.io/blog/SEO-Basics&quot;&gt;HTML Markup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Republican Party’s HTML Markup is lacking in a number of areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;title-tag&quot;&gt;Title Tag&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The Maryland Republican Party’s site has a good title tag, and uses the proper format they might want to replace the dash (-) with a vertical bar (&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;).&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;meta-description&quot;&gt;Meta Description&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are lacking any Meta Description on all of their pages. One thing that they can add is a general description of each page, and what can be found on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;other-head-tags&quot;&gt;Other &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; Tags&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rest of head&amp;gt; section seems to be in good shape with the exception of the social media tags. The Facebook tag doesn’t have a picture of the landing page and the description for Facebook is “Joe Cluster, Executive Director of the Maryland Republican Party, was recently appointed to the Maryland House of Delegates and is leaving the Party on December 31, 2016. The MDGOP is..” because the ‘og: description’ property should be explicitly provided. For twitter the description is blank causing a similar problem to Facebook and has no picture, which means that they are losing out on making their tweets more fat finger friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;image&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Images has no ALT text this is a huge problem. The best ALT text for the landing page image is “Maryland Republican Governor Larry Hogan Greets excited crowd “. Also try to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scrset&lt;/code&gt; to help with load times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;other-body-tags&quot;&gt;Other Body Tags&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Join Governor Larry Hogan &amp;amp; the Maryland Republican Party to change Maryland for the better!” should be in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. Also they should remove the commit above the header due to Internet Explorer, along with removing the end tag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that has no open element, and the unclosed element &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;off-page-ranking-factors&quot;&gt;Off-Page Ranking Factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the off-page factors are defiantly the strongest part of the website. It has high quality back links from newspapers and government sites, and lacks any spam quality links. The one suggestion I would give them is that try to reach out to influences both locally and nationally through social media. Also, they need to start to focus on Key Performance Indicators like email sign up or RSVP for an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final peace of the Site Audit is to look at Maryland Republican Party main competitor Maryland Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top 5 Keywords by traffic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Keyword&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Percent of Search Traffic&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1\. maryland voter registration&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;15.42%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2\. maryland democratic party&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;13.53%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3\. md party&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;8.27%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;4\. democratic party website&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;5.10%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;5\. maryland democratic delegates&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;3.93%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their keywords seem to be border, and 2 of the keywords are generic searches with Maryland voter registration being their best performing. This is a keyword that the MD GOP should target because it is a basic search for new voters that could be more persuadable. In terms of backlink opportunities there seems to not be any given they are earning them through affiliate organizations and news stories. That being said linking with other GOP groups is something that could benefit The Republicans site.&lt;/p&gt;
